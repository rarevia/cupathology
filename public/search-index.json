[{"content":"Example Headers: “Stoma, ileostomy:”\nTriage Needed: None, usually received in formalin.\nProcedure: Document the specimen as it was received (overall measurements) and describe what is present (skin, protruding mucosa, viable/normal bowel, and/or any lesions or abnormalities). Remove the staple line and put the margin en face in a cassette. A perpendicular section through the stoma to include the exposed mucosa, relationship to the peripheral skin, and mucosa deep to the opening. This can be completed in one section provided there are no lesions or abnormalities. If lesions and/or abnormalities are present, these must be described, measured, and the distance to the peripheral and bowel margin are required for microscopic examination. Note if this patient has a history of a variety of cancers in the abdomen, the most likely site for a metastasis is along the periphery of the specimen and less likely on the mucosal surface. The margin needs to be submitted along with a section through the stoma in two cassettes. Description: These specimens are often removed when there is revision surgery, the stoma needs to be moved, or the bowels are reconnected, and the stoma is no longer necessary. Aside from documentation of the ileostomy specimen, the gross exam should include the condition of the stoma and mucosa to make sure the bowel was not incarcerated or dusky. The viability of the mucosal margin needs to be confirmed and ensure there is no pathology on the mucosal surface and along the periphery of the soft tissues and bowel.\nSections for Histology: Perpendicular section through the stomal opening Mucosal resection margin, en face, if there are any lesions Dragon Template: “GI stoma”\nDictation Example: Received in a formalin container labeled \u0026ldquo;[patient\u0026rsquo;s name/MRN/site]\u0026rdquo; is [an intact/disrupted] [ileostomy/colostomy] specimen, [# x # x #] cm, with staples across the base margin.

The prophylactic side can be bypassed if no clips/suspicion for bilateral disease.\nKeep in mind each breast specimen is unique and deviation from the template can occur as long as all required elements and sections are included.\nTriage Confirm the laterality of the breast on the container and requisition sheet. Additionally confirm the orientation using any attached designators (e.g., sutures). If discordant, confirm that an error is present with a PA or your attending. You may need to call the opearting room for assistance.\nWrite down the weight and measure the dimensions of the specimen\nSuperior -to- inferior Medial -to- lateral Anterior -to- posterior Ink the specimen according to the protocol (see Sample dictation for the inking conventions). Any deviations from the standard inking convention must be noted on the requisition sheet.\nSerially section the specimen perpendicular to the superior-inferior axis into thin slices (approximately 1 cm or less) trying to get teh posterior surface in each slice. Cut the slices deep enough to be able to view the whole slice. If skin is present along the anterior surface, it will help hold the specimen together.\nWhen the entire specimen is sectioned, collect a sample for the tissue bank (if this was consented for); othewise, put the specimen into formalin.\nIf a clip or savi scout is dislodged, secure a safety pin in the slice/location for reference.\nIf a radioactive seed is found - stop what you are doing - tell a PA or Gross Tech to make sure it is handled appropriately.

If the breast tissue was removed from the patient on Thursday afternoon (and is grossed on Friday), then the container the specimen is in will have a biohazard sticker on it (this sticker is our way of designating that this specimen should follow this \u0026ldquo;Thursday breast protocol\u0026rdquo;) These cassettes will need to be separated in the rack on top of the decal and labeled with the Thursday breast sign. These rack will be loaded Friday night and the weekend residents will take them out of the processor on Saturday morning. If there is a lot to process during the week and it won\u0026rsquo;t all fit on the Peloris machines, then prioritize the breast rack to go on the Peloris machines (you do not have to move them to different racks) Circle the appropriate processing information on the breast log on the door to histology.

Describe the serosal surface and if there is any attached soft tissue. Describe the anastomotic line, if it is well healed, intact, disrupted, dusky, gaping, etc. and the distance to each of the margins. Note the diameter of the lumen throughout the specimen- it is easier to assess prior to opening but can be identified after opening by measuring the circumference of the lumen at several areas and at least pre and post the anastomosis. The margins adjacent to the anastomotic line should be sampled along with any pathologies or abnormalities that were identified. Description: Anastomoses are revised mostly due to stricture or leak at the staple line. They can also be revised in the event another procedure has occurred and that connection is no longer needed or can be simplified. These are the things to describe and sample when grossing the specimen. Due to the embedded staples, it is appropriate to take sections adjacent to the staples and not through unless staples are pulled.\nSections for Histology: Resection margins (sometimes more than 2, maintain orientation if able to discern) Any area of perforation or pathology Representatives of mucosa adjacent to the anastomotic staple line Dragon Template: “GI anastomosis”\nDictation Example: Received in a formalin container labeled \u0026ldquo;[patient\u0026rsquo;s name/MRN/site]\u0026rdquo; is [an intact/disrupted] [pedunculated/sessile] polyp with a resection margin that is inked [black].

Often sent fresh for tissue banking.\nProcedure: Describe the tissue (or organ) and any identifiable structures or landmarks. Use three dimensions as required. Note if any lesions are identified. These often (but not always) are mucinous or soft, and most commonly along the surfaces of structures, organs, and the abdominal cavity. Use a third dimension to describe if the lesion appears thickened or infiltrative into the tissue. Describe any normal or other organs/structures within the specimen and detail if they are involved or not with the lesion. If small (2 blocks) these can be entirely submitted. If larger, representative sections to include structures and involvement are most important. Margins are important if you are sampling the primary lesion or are clinically significant (tumor at margin). Do not need to follow 1/cm rule if it is metastatic or not the primary specimen. Description: These specimens are to reduce the tumor burden and increase efficacy of hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) procedures. This procedure is used to treat advanced abdominal cancers. These specimens are typically non routine in the fact that they’re removed based on the presence of tumor on the outside of them and differ from patient to patient. This part of the manual describes the non-consistency patient to patient and gives a general equation for sections and a basic template to use for the gross description.\nSections for Histology: One or two representative sections demonstrating lesion into identifiable structures or adherent to surfaces Margins Any lesion that appears more solid or has a different appearance Dragon Template: none\nDictation Example: Received in a formalin container labeled \u0026ldquo;[patient\u0026rsquo;s name/MRN/site]\u0026rdquo; is [an irregular, tan-pink, tissue fragment], [# x # x #] cm, with [a translucent mucinous lesion], [# x # x #] cm, [across the peritonealized surface].

Each of these cases is different and confirming with the attending, fellow, senior resident or PA is recommended. A pilot section should be taken and submitted for processing to limit formalin exposure.\nProcedure: Look into into the history of the lesion, from the H\u0026amp;P, imaging, and notes from the OR procedure Review anatomy and grossing of the individual pelvic organs if needed and then take out the specimen and orient yourself to it and identify organs and structures Discuss plan with the attending, fellow, senior resident or PA and plans to show best pathology Specimen should be triaged and at least fixed for several hours or overnight depending on when it came in Remember your gross should consist of what you have, what are the measurements overall, describing the tumor, how big it is, what does it looks like, and where is it going. If you talk about it, take a section of it. If this is not a primary resection of the primary tumor, lymph nodes and 1/cm do not necessarily apply. Description: Pelvic exenterations are an en bloc multivisceral resection of pelvic structures that is used to debulk for a variety of cancers. Each of these cases is different so there is a lack of uniformity in terms of templates.

Describe the appearance of the serosal surface noting any irregularities or discolorations and ink them if necessary. Open along the greater curvature and describe the contents. Once completed, rinse the mucosa gently and describe the mucosal surface, if there is an appropriate rugal folding pattern. Look for any lesions, polyps or abnormalities. Note it is uncommon to find a significant lesion. Note the pliability of the wall and average thickness throughout. The wall pliability can be best assessed with physical manipulation throughout the specimen. Determine (with the help and guidance of an attending, fellow, senior resident or PA) the amount of specimen to submit and how to map using the photo software. Strips should be 3mm in thickness and either the length of the stomach (preference) or horizontal. The specimen needs to be submitted sequentially with some sort of organization. By sectioning into strips, the wall can be examined for abnormalities or lesions. Any lesions should be measured and the relationships to the margins should be described. If the specimen is not submitted in its entirety- it should be sampled extensively and adequately to find individual cancer cells or groups. Description: Prophylactic gastrectomy specimens are recommended in the event of CDH1 mutations and identified familial predisposition. Almost all these cases do not have a lesion so sequential sampling with photo mapping is the best way to process these specimens. Lymph nodes can be submitted up front so going back to the bucket does not need to happen should carcinoma be found but is not required.\nSections for Histology: If no distinct lesion or thickening is identified the specimen should be mapped and submitted entirely. *This is important to discuss with attending prior to grossing.

Pin the lesion area on corkboard. Often these are fixed overnight.\nProcedure: These sepcimens often arrive fresh for frozen section diagnosis and or tissue banking. If there are ANY outstanding questions regarding how the specimen was received, pertinent measurements, appearance, relationships, if it was intact or disrupted and what was frozen if it is not clear you MUST follow up with the responsible individuals or ask a PA for assistance. Not asking for clarification or doing some investigation is not acceptable. If the specimen is not inked and opened, ink the radial esophageal margin and any puckering or abnormality on the serosal surface of the stomach. The serosal surface does not need to be inked because it will rub off. If there is puckering or exposed tumor the ink will stick to those abnormalities. Open the specimen to avoid the lesion (use a finger to probe and identify the lesion prior to cutting that area). It is most common to open along the greater curvature, but if the lesion is in the way, this can be modified. If the lesion is cut into that is ok as it may be not palpable or circumferential. If it is bisected remember to add both sides together for the measurement. Grossly determine from which area of the stomach the tumor arises: To do this, examine the appearance of the tumor and its relationship (i.e. tumor epicenter) to the gastroesophageal junction. If within 2 cm of the gastroesophageal junction, refer to the esophagus area of this document. Describe the lesion along with its dimensions and distances to the proximal (possibly esophageal), distal, and radial/deep margin. Does the resection include the pyloric junction or not? Describe the remaining mucosa both esophagus and stomach including any additional lesions or abnormalities. Palpate the esophageal (if present) and stomach adipose for lymph node candidates. While 16 lymph nodes are the minimum to stage gastric carcinoma, do not stop at 16. ALL the lymph nodes must be identified and submitted. If only a few were palpated and or at the direction of the attending or fellow- all periesophageal and peri gastric adipose can be submitted following the lymph node search for additional lymph node capture. Description: Gastric cancer lymph nodes staging is based on the submission of at least 16 lymph nodes per CAP and \u0026gt;30 per AJCC should be submitted. Adipose may be submitted for possible additional lymph node capture AFTER a meticulous search for lymph nodes in the adipose. Mapping the submitted sections may be beneficial over just a gross photograph in the event of a diffuse type of carcinoma or no discrete lesion to confirm actual size of lesion following microscopy.\nSections for Histology: Margins (proximal and distal), each en face and entirely submitted Lesion 1/cm to include the greatest depth of invasion and distance to margin if appropriate Any additional areas of interest or abnormality Lymph nodes - ALL of them If 30 high quality candidates are not identified - submit additional adipose for possible lymph node capture Dragon Template: “Gastric tumor”\nDictation Example: Received [fresh for frozen section diagnosis, tissue banking and subsequently placed in formalin] labeled \u0026ldquo;[patient\u0026rsquo;s name/MRN/site]\u0026rdquo; is a partial [proximal] gastrectomy specimen, [# x # x #]cm, with attached distal esophagus, [# x #] cm and inked [blue].

Describe the appearance of the serosal surface noting any irregularities or discolorations and ink them if they are present. If there are no abnormalities the serosa does not need to be inked.

Section the specimen perpendicular to the staple line and observe the relationships of the lesion to the gastric wall, the color, consistency and shape of the lesion and relationships to the adjacent tissues and surfaces. Rinse the mucosa gently and describe the mucosal surface. Identify the lesion, measure in three dimensions and the distance to the margin. Describe where the lesion is located and which layers of the gastric wall the lesion is into and/or through.

If there are ANY outstanding questions regarding how the specimen was received, pertinent measurements, appearance, relationships, if it was intact or disrupted and what was frozen if it is not clear you MUST follow up with the responsible individuals or ask a PA for assistance. Not asking for clarification or doing some investigation is not acceptable. If the specimen is not inked and opened, ink the radial esophageal margin and any puckering or abnormality on the serosal surface of the stomach. The serosal surface does not need to be inked because it will rub off. If there is puckering or exposed tumor the ink will stick to those abnormalities. Open the specimen to avoid the lesion (use a finger to probe and identify the lesion prior to cutting that area). It is most common to open along the greater curvature, but if the lesion is in the way, this can be modified. If the lesion is cut into that is ok as it may be not palpable or circumferential. If it is bisected remember to add both sides together for the measurement. Grossly determine from which structure the tumor arises: is it gastric, gastroesophageal junctional, or esophageal in origin. To do this, examine the appearance of the tumor and its relationship (i.e., tumor epicenter) to the gastroesophageal junction. Measure the distance of the tumor’s epicenter from the gastroesophageal junction. Describe the lesion along with its dimensions and distances to the proximal, distal, and radial/deep margin.

Any deviations from the standard inking convention must be noted on the requisition sheet. Serially section the specimen perpendicular to the long axis and it out flat on a napkin or gauze while keeping the margin maps/clips intact when possible. If a clip/savi scout is dislodged, secure a safety pin in the slice/location for reference. If a radioactive seed is found - stop what you are doing - tell a PA or Gross Tech to make sure it is handled appropriately. When the entire specimen is laod out, wrap the specimen so taht the slices will stay secure within the container. Note the in formalin time on the requistion sheet and if a tumor sample or normal breast tissue sample was give to teh biorepository. Grossing Look up the patient\u0026rsquo;s history in EPIC and determine the suspected size and type of lesion, if there are any clips present, and any other pertinent history (as the history on th requisition sheet may be incomplete). Review all breast specimens with your attending or their designee (discuss your attending\u0026rsquo;s preferences for specimen review at the beginning of the service week). Take gross photographs of the laid out specimen and print it out for mapping (ask someone if you do not know how to do this). Find lesions/clips/scouts within the laid out specimen. You can put the specimen back together to re-approximate the size of lesions. Note what slice the lesions is in, what clips/scouts are present to identify lesions, and the distances from the lesions to all margins: superior inferior anterior posterior/deep medial lateral On the printed photograph depicting the laid out specimen, draw which pieces of tissue are submitted in which cassettes (i.e., create a cassette key). Write the case number on the sheet. Any lumpectomy that can be submitted entirely in 15 cassettes or fewer should be submitted entirely.

If the breast tissue was removed from the patient on Thursday afternoon (and is grossed on Friday), then the container the specimen is in will have a biohazard sticker on it (this sticker is our way of designating that this specimen should follow this \u0026ldquo;Thursday breast protocol\u0026rdquo;) These cassettes will need to be separated in the rack on top of the decal and labeled with the Thursday breast sign. These rack will be loaded Friday night and the weekend residents will take them out of the processor on Saturday morning. If there is a lot to process during the week and it won\u0026rsquo;t all fit on the Peloris machines, then prioritize the breast rack to go on the Peloris machines (you do not have to move them to different racks) Circle the appropriate processing information on the breast log on the door to histology.
