[{"content":"To ensure proper key characteristics, measurements and sampling occur in the grossing of breast specimens (partial/simple/skin sparing/nipple sparing/modified radical/radical mastectomy, etc.) please take note of the following considerations, required sections, and template below. ALL cancer breasts need to be scanned in the Faxitron and images used for clip localization and confirmation. The prophylactic side can be bypassed if no clips/suspicion for bilateral disease.\nKeep in mind each breast specimen is unique and deviation from the template can occur as long as all required elements and sections are included.\nTriage Confirm the laterality of the breast on the container and requisition sheet. Additionally confirm the orientation using any attached designators (e.g., sutures). If discordant, confirm that an error is present with a PA or your attending. You may need to call the opearting room for assistance.\nWrite down the weight and measure the dimensions of the specimen\nSuperior -to- inferior Medial -to- lateral Anterior -to- posterior Ink the specimen according to the protocol (see Sample dictaiton for the inking conventions). Any deviations from the standard inking convention must be noted on the requisition sheet.\nSerially section the specimen perpendicular to the superior-inferior axis into thin slices (approximately 1 cm or less) trying to get teh posterior surface in each slice. Cut the slices deep enough to be able to view the whole slice. If skin is present along the anterior surface, it will help hold the specimen together.\nWhen the entire specimen is sectioned, collect a sample for the tissue bank (if this was consented for); othewise, put the specimen into formalin.\nIf a clip or savi scout is dislodged, secure a safety pin in the slice/location for reference.\nIf a radioactive seed is found - stop what you are doing - tell a PA or Gross Tech to make sure it is handled appropriately. When the entire specimen is laod out, wrap the specimen so taht the slices will stay secure within the container.\nNote the in formalin time on the requistion sheet and if a tumor sample or normal breast tissue sample was give to teh biorepository.\nGrossing Elements to include:\nWeight of entire specimen (look on lid or requisition if triaged) Dimensions: superior-to-inferior medial-to-lateral anterior-to-posterior and overall size of axillary dissection (if present) Measurements of skin ellipse (if present) along with description of any lesions Nipple size, retraction, inversion, and description Deep margin irregularities (fascial plane should be smooth and intact) Lesion: size, location, quadrant, length from nipple, color, distance to margins, presence of clip(s) Description: color, borders, consistency, relationship to margins (anterior, Posterior/deep, skin (medial/lateral if involved)) Description of remaining tissue Faxitron findings Lymph nodes and size if axillary dissection is present Also, ALWAYS check lateral aspect for low lymph nodes incidentally removed and submit entirely Muscle dimensions and presence/absence of involvement if present on the deep aspect Required Sections:\nNipple and skin, perpendicular Lesion in plane of greatest dimension including to all closest margins: superior inferior anterior posterior/deep medial lateral Sections in plane of lesion on either side of greatest dimension (appear uninvolved) Tissue between two lesions (if applicable) Representative sections (2 and can be in 1 cassette) of uninvolved breast in each of the 4 quadrants Muscle if present Dictation template Received fresh in a container labeled “[Patient’s name/MRN]” and designated “[___]” is a [___] gram, [name of specimen/procedure] specimen, [___x___] cm superior to inferior, [___x___] cm medial to lateral, [___x___] cm anterior to posterior.

If the breast tissue was removed from the patient on Thursday afternoon (and is grossed on Friday), then the container the specimen is in will have a biohazard sticker on it (this sticker is our way of designating that this specimen should follow this \u0026ldquo;Thursday breast protocol\u0026rdquo;) These cassettes will need to be separated in the rack on top of the decal and labeled with the Thursday breast sign. These rack will be loaded Friday night and the weekend residents will take them out of the processor on Saturday morning. If there is a lot to process during the week and it won\u0026rsquo;t all fit on the Peloris machines, then prioritize the breast rack to go on the Peloris machines (you do not have to move them to different racks) Circle the appropriate processing information on the breast log on the door to histology.

See SOP Write down the weight and measure the dimensions of the specimen Superior -to- inferior Medial -to- lateral Anterior -to- posterior Ink the specimen according to the protocol (see Sample dictaiton for the inking conventions). Any deviations from the standard inking convention must be noted on the requisition sheet. Serially section the specimen perpendicular to the long axis and it out flat on a napkin or gauze while keeping the margin maps/clips intact when possible. If a clip/savi scout is dislodged, secure a safety pin in the slice/location for reference. If a radioactive seed is found - stop what you are doing - tell a PA or Gross Tech to make sure it is handled appropriately.
