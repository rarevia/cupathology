[{"content":"Example Headers: “Stoma, ileostomy:”\nTriage Needed: None, usually received in formalin.\nProcedure: Document the specimen as it was received (overall measurements) and describe what is present (skin, protruding mucosa, viable/normal bowel, and/or any lesions or abnormalities). Remove the staple line and put the margin en face in a cassette. A perpendicular section through the stoma to include the exposed mucosa, relationship to the peripheral skin, and mucosa deep to the opening. This can be completed in one section provided there are no lesions or abnormalities. If lesions and/or abnormalities are present, these must be described, measured, and the distance to the peripheral and bowel margin are required for microscopic examination. Note if this patient has a history of a variety of cancers in the abdomen, the most likely site for a metastasis is along the periphery of the specimen and less likely on the mucosal surface. The margin needs to be submitted along with a section through the stoma in two cassettes. Description: These specimens are often removed when there is revision surgery, the stoma needs to be moved, or the bowels are reconnected, and the stoma is no longer necessary. Aside from documentation of the ileostomy specimen, the gross exam should include the condition of the stoma and mucosa to make sure the bowel was not incarcerated or dusky.

The prophylactic side can be bypassed if no clips/suspicion for bilateral disease.\nKeep in mind each breast specimen is unique and deviation from the template can occur as long as all required elements and sections are included.\nTriage Confirm the laterality of the breast on the container and requisition sheet. Additionally confirm the orientation using any attached designators (e.g., sutures). If discordant, confirm that an error is present with a PA or your attending. You may need to call the opearting room for assistance.\nWrite down the weight and measure the dimensions of the specimen\nSuperior -to- inferior Medial -to- lateral Anterior -to- posterior Ink the specimen according to the protocol (see Sample dictation for the inking conventions). Any deviations from the standard inking convention must be noted on the requisition sheet.\nSerially section the specimen perpendicular to the superior-inferior axis into thin slices (approximately 1 cm or less) trying to get teh posterior surface in each slice. Cut the slices deep enough to be able to view the whole slice. If skin is present along the anterior surface, it will help hold the specimen together.\nWhen the entire specimen is sectioned, collect a sample for the tissue bank (if this was consented for); othewise, put the specimen into formalin.\nIf a clip or savi scout is dislodged, secure a safety pin in the slice/location for reference.\nIf a radioactive seed is found - stop what you are doing - tell a PA or Gross Tech to make sure it is handled appropriately.

If the breast tissue was removed from the patient on Thursday afternoon (and is grossed on Friday), then the container the specimen is in will have a biohazard sticker on it (this sticker is our way of designating that this specimen should follow this \u0026ldquo;Thursday breast protocol\u0026rdquo;) These cassettes will need to be separated in the rack on top of the decal and labeled with the Thursday breast sign. These rack will be loaded Friday night and the weekend residents will take them out of the processor on Saturday morning. If there is a lot to process during the week and it won\u0026rsquo;t all fit on the Peloris machines, then prioritize the breast rack to go on the Peloris machines (you do not have to move them to different racks) Circle the appropriate processing information on the breast log on the door to histology.

They can also be revised in the event another procedure has occurred and that connection is no longer needed or can be simplified.

A Yes, absolutely. In this case, gross photos are required, as this is the only evidence we will have that we examined this case. It is best to check with the attending on service before grossing. As a default, submit a few sections for microscopic review. Q For cases with fetal and placental tissue that are specified as “gross eval only” by the patient, should we submit placental tissue for microscopic review? A This is case dependent and ultimately up to the attending. The “gross eval only” is understood to apply to fetal tissue only. It is best to check the clinical history for any concern for placental pathology and/or to check with the attending on service before grossing. As a default, submit a few sections of placenta for microscopic review. Q How much detail should be included in the Gross Description of the final report for a case with fetal tissue? A This is very much case dependent and attending discretion is required. In certain cases it may be appropriate for the attending to change the gross description to simply read “fetal and placental tissue present” Reporting\nQ How much detail should be included in the Final Diagnosis for a case with fetal tissue? A This is very much case dependent and attending discretion is required. The goal is to try to provide a level of detail commensurate with patient desire; a quick review of the clinical history/EPIC notes usually will suffice, but an email to the clinician can be very helpful in questionable cases. The default, per clinician-pathologist discussions, is to provide minimal detail. For cases with suspected anomaly, it is appropriate to list the anomalies in the Final Diagnosis. Please avoid use of the word “fragmented” (as in “fragmented fetal parts”) and other gratuitous graphic detail, including within the gross description. Examples of Final Diagnoses: Uterine contents:\nPlacental and fetal tissue (gross evaluation only) Uterine contents:\nPlacental and fetal tissue Uterine contents:\nFetus (___ weeks gestational age based on foot length = ___ cm) Immature placental tissue with ___ (Listing of additional anomalies where indicated interest by clinicians) Prodcuts of Conception: Spontaneous abortions (SABs) - including first trimester “losses” (missed abortions, empty sacs, blighted ovum), second trimester miscarriages (incompetent cervix, preterm labor, intrauterine fetal demise) Therapeutic abortions (TABs) - which are induced procedures for a variety of reasons including: Social (maternal request for legal termination of pregnancy) Maternal indications (severe diseases exacerbated by pregnancy) Fetal indications (structural or chromosomal anomalies) Rule out ectopic pregnancies - generally a first trimester pregnancy with pain and bleeding and an abnormal rise or fall in the serum bHcg levels Indicate in your block summary what percentage of specimen has been submitted e.g., The specimen is 40% submitted in (A1-A4), etc. For fetal remains cases, please do not cut/submit the fetal hearts unless you have evaluated it with an attending/experienced PA first. In an ideal world, please look up if there are expected cardiac anomalies, and if so, call the attending/PA to come gross the heart with you. If you cannot find anything in the chart referencing a suspected cardiac anomaly, please DO NOT cut/submit the heart at all/no need to call attending; but do continue with grossing the rest of the case as usual. We are trying to avoid cutting/submitting a heart from a suspected cardiac anomaly case such that we can then no longer evaluate for that anomaly. For fetal remains cases, avoid providing excessive/graphic detail in gross descriptions beyond what is suggested in the gross templates below. For cases in which we are doing an autopsy exam on surgical pathology, you may need to provide external measurements or internal organ weights. Check with your attending for how detailed to be in your exam.

These sections should include areas of disruption as well as intact cotyledons. For any placenta with intrauterine fetal demise (IUFD), always submit 10 cassettes – 1 each umbilical cord and membranes (more if you see something unusual, obviously), and the remaining 8 for placental disc. Please be sure to measure placental discs in 3 dimensions. There have been cases where one of the dimensions has been cut off (the report has only shown X x X cm), so I’ve asked the transcriptionists to insert a blank/notify us so that it can be filled in appropriately.

When you have an (attached) umbilical cord with a true knot, submit your proximal/distal sections in separate cassettes, and designate which is in which cassette. Please take a gross photo of the true knot. If you are grossly concerned for anastomosis of vessels in a multiple gestation placenta, take pictures for documentation For a forked cord, state distance to disc edge, can take sections of both forks Gross Examination Examine the membranes and cord: Cord: How many vessels?

Hematomas, cysts, aneurysms\u0026hellip; Membranes: Color (green, brown, pink) Transparency (can you see the fetal vessels on the chorionic plate clearly? can you read a ruler through the membranes easily?) Nodules? yellow or white? Insertion into disk: marginal, inside margin (circummarginate), inside margin with prominent fibrin deposition (circumvallate) After measurements and examination, cut the cord off at the disc and take two sections of cord (proximal and distal). Take TWO membrane rolls: one at the site of rupture (if identified) and one elsewhere. Cut a strip of membranes about 2 cm wide from the most distal portion of the disk. Include a small portion of disk margin. Wrap a \u0026ldquo;jelly roll\u0026rdquo; of membranes. Cut transversely and submit one section from each roll. Once the membrane rolls are done, trim the remaining membranes off the disc and then weigh and measure the disc. Examine the placental disc: After the placenta has been weighed, bread loaf the placenta at 1-2 cm intervals perpendicular to the maternal surface. Examine the parenchyma for infarcts, thrombi, cysts, masses, pallor, or other pathology. Examine the maternal floor for hematomas (fresh or organized) and/or excessive bandlike fibrin. Examine the fetal surface for discoloration, fibrin, nodules, cysts, or other pathology. Dictate findings including color and texture (red/boggy/beefy, pink/firm, etc.). Any of these abnormalities are what you will want to include in your 3 parenchyma sections. Try to stay away from the edge when taking the parenchymal sections unless it’s the site of a lesion/abnormality.

Measure all subcutaneous lesions including greatest depth of invasion and distances to 2 closest margins. Take a gross photos, including a cross section of tumor if one is grossly visible Sequentially slice the specimen and number the slices (ex: The specimen is sequentially sectioned into 12 slices from 12:00 to 6:00.) For any submitted section, consider noting the slice # (+/- the o’clock position) in the casette key and annotating the gross photo to indicate specifically where you took sections.

A pilot section should be taken and submitted for processing to limit formalin exposure.\nProcedure: Note the integrity of the mesorectal envelope and take a photo if you are unsure if it is complete, near complete or incomplete Describe and measure the lesion in two dimensions and note the distance to closest proximal, distal, and radial margins. Serially section lesion and measure depth of invasion into wall and distance from inked serosa and radial margin (non-peritonealized surface). Identify and ink the radial margin (non-peritonealized surface) and note if the lesion is located above, at, below, or straddles the retroperitoneal reflection. Photograph cut surface at deepest point of invasion Submit 1/cm of lesion and include one of the greatest depth of invasion and/or an additional to the radial margin ink. If only a treated TUMOR BED is present, submit ENTIRELY. Describe and submit any additional lesions or polyps Dissect and submit as many lymph nodes as you can find: Note: Lymph nodes are difficult to find below the peritoneal reflection in APR or LAR specimens especially with prior treatment. Submit ALL the lymph nodes you can find and if adequate lymph nodes are not identified, you may need to go back to the bucket. This means both a palpated and sectioned adipose that is separated from the bowel segment. Description: These specimens are like hemicolectomy specimens but just with the addition of the anal canal and perianal skin details need to be added along with the completeness of the mesorectal envelope.\nSections for Histology: Pilot section of tumor (usually 1st block with ‘pilot’ other block number) Margins (proximal, distal, radial, peritoneal) en face Lesion 1/cm or entirely submitted depending on size and if carcinoma is confirmed on biopsy or suspected Any other findings Lymph nodes - ALL of them Minimum of 12 required for adequate staging Dragon Template: “Colo LAR”\nDictation Example: Received [fresh/ in formalin] in a container labeled “[patient’s name/MRN/site]” is a [non-]perforated, segment of colon [and rectum/anus], [# x # x # cm].

Measurements and margins (if taken) should be documented on container or requisition.\nProcedure: Measure the length and diameter range of all the components noting the presence or absence of the appendix for right hemicolectomy and total colectomy specimens. Once opened, measure the range of bowel wall thicknesses especially when associated with any of the findings below. Describe the serosal surface of the bowel, noting color, granularity, indurations, perforations, stricture, fistula, anastomoses, distribution of fat, and adhesions and the distance of these to each of the margins. Describe mucosal surface, noting color, ulcers, pseudopolyps, diverticula, or indurated areas and if there is associated fibrous induration or perforation with abscess into the pericolonic soft tissues. Measure the length, diameter or circumference, wall thickness, location (distance from the closest margin or ileocecal valve) and appearance of any stenosis/stricture. Indicate extent of disease involvement, and whether it is diffuse, patchy, focal, or multifocal. Measure the length or area if focal disease and document the location (distance to closest margin or ileocecal valve). Palpate/dissect mesenteric tissue for lymph nodes, noting size and appearance of representative nodes (if no cancer identified or suspected a complete dissection is not necessary. Description: Diverticular disease is often caused by a lack of fiber in the diet leading to strain and a weak bowel wall. The diverticulum can become filled with fecaliths and leak fluids or perforate leading to fecal material going into the pelvic cavity. An ischemic bowel is a complication due to torsion, obstruction, ischemia, or trauma. Sometimes the obstruction or stenosis is due to an otherwise unknown tumor and the specimen is now a resection for primary tumor requiring a complete workup including full lymph node dissection. It is important to note the distances of the diverticula to the margins and dusky bowel also to the margins. The margins should be viable and sampled to confirm.\nSections for Histology: Margins (proximal, distal, radial) en face Diverticula Any other findings Lymph nodes - sample - a complete lymph node search is not required for a colon without tumor Dragon Template: “Colo Tic”\nDictation Example: Received in formalin labeled \u0026ldquo;[patient name/ MRN/ Site]\u0026rdquo; is an unoriented segment of colon, [#] cm in length and a diameter [ranging from 1.5-3.5] cm, with [staples at both resection margins] and attached pericolonic adipose.

If it is not complete- include in the gross description. Describe if the margins (proximal and distal) are stapled or open and its overall size in three dimensions. Describe the appearance of the serosal surface noting any irregularities or discolorations and ink them if necessary. Open along the greater curvature and describe the contents. Once completed, rinse the mucosa gently and describe the mucosal surface, if there is an appropriate rugal folding pattern. Look for any lesions, polyps or abnormalities. Note it is uncommon to find a significant lesion. Note the pliability of the wall and average thickness throughout. The wall pliability can be best assessed with physical manipulation throughout the specimen. Determine (with the help and guidance of an attending, fellow, senior resident or PA) the amount of specimen to submit and how to map using the photo software. Strips should be 3mm in thickness and either the length of the stomach (preference) or horizontal. The specimen needs to be submitted sequentially with some sort of organization. By sectioning into strips, the wall can be examined for abnormalities or lesions. Any lesions should be measured and the relationships to the margins should be described. If the specimen is not submitted in its entirety- it should be sampled extensively and adequately to find individual cancer cells or groups. Description: Prophylactic gastrectomy specimens are recommended in the event of CDH1 mutations and identified familial predisposition. Almost all these cases do not have a lesion so sequential sampling with photo mapping is the best way to process these specimens. Lymph nodes can be submitted up front so going back to the bucket does not need to happen should carcinoma be found but is not required.\nSections for Histology: If no distinct lesion or thickening is identified the specimen should be mapped and submitted entirely. *This is important to discuss with attending prior to grossing. Strategic sampling may be preferred.\nDictation Template: “Gastric Mutant”\nDictation Example: Received in formalin in a container labeled \u0026ldquo;[patient\u0026rsquo;s name/MRN/site]\u0026rdquo; is a total gastrectomy specimen [# x # x #] cm, with stapled resection margins and [including a distal esophagus segment], [# x #] cm, which is inked [blue].

Pin the lesion area on corkboard. Often these are fixed overnight.\nProcedure: These sepcimens often arrive fresh for frozen section diagnosis and or tissue banking. If there are ANY outstanding questions regarding how the specimen was received, pertinent measurements, appearance, relationships, if it was intact or disrupted and what was frozen if it is not clear you MUST follow up with the responsible individuals or ask a PA for assistance. Not asking for clarification or doing some investigation is not acceptable. If the specimen is not inked and opened, ink the radial esophageal margin and any puckering or abnormality on the serosal surface of the stomach. The serosal surface does not need to be inked because it will rub off. If there is puckering or exposed tumor the ink will stick to those abnormalities. Open the specimen to avoid the lesion (use a finger to probe and identify the lesion prior to cutting that area). It is most common to open along the greater curvature, but if the lesion is in the way, this can be modified. If the lesion is cut into that is ok as it may be not palpable or circumferential. If it is bisected remember to add both sides together for the measurement. Grossly determine from which area of the stomach the tumor arises: To do this, examine the appearance of the tumor and its relationship (i.e. tumor epicenter) to the gastroesophageal junction. If within 2 cm of the gastroesophageal junction, refer to the esophagus area of this document. Describe the lesion along with its dimensions and distances to the proximal (possibly esophageal), distal, and radial/deep margin. Does the resection include the pyloric junction or not? Describe the remaining mucosa both esophagus and stomach including any additional lesions or abnormalities. Palpate the esophageal (if present) and stomach adipose for lymph node candidates. While 16 lymph nodes are the minimum to stage gastric carcinoma, do not stop at 16. ALL the lymph nodes must be identified and submitted. If only a few were palpated and or at the direction of the attending or fellow- all periesophageal and peri gastric adipose can be submitted following the lymph node search for additional lymph node capture. Description: Gastric cancer lymph nodes staging is based on the submission of at least 16 lymph nodes per CAP and \u0026gt;30 per AJCC should be submitted. Adipose may be submitted for possible additional lymph node capture AFTER a meticulous search for lymph nodes in the adipose. Mapping the submitted sections may be beneficial over just a gross photograph in the event of a diffuse type of carcinoma or no discrete lesion to confirm actual size of lesion following microscopy.\nSections for Histology: Margins (proximal and distal), each en face and entirely submitted Lesion 1/cm to include the greatest depth of invasion and distance to margin if appropriate Any additional areas of interest or abnormality Lymph nodes - ALL of them If 30 high quality candidates are not identified - submit additional adipose for possible lymph node capture Dragon Template: “Gastric tumor”\nDictation Example: Received [fresh for frozen section diagnosis, tissue banking and subsequently placed in formalin] labeled \u0026ldquo;[patient\u0026rsquo;s name/MRN/site]\u0026rdquo; is a partial [proximal] gastrectomy specimen, [# x # x #]cm, with attached distal esophagus, [# x #] cm and inked [blue].

GIST for stomach\nExample Header: Stomach, partial gastrectomy\nTriage Needed: None, this specimen may need to be fixed overnight (but not always)\nProcedure: State the condition of the stomach wedge and its overall size in three dimensions. These specimens are usually unoriented, with staples across the resection margin and minimal omentum (if any). State this and if they appear different than the norm. Describe the appearance of the serosal surface noting any irregularities or discolorations and ink them if they are present. If there are no abnormalities the serosa does not need to be inked. Open along the specimen staple line, 0.3 cm from the staple line if the lesion is palpated as far from the margin and submit the entire strip of mucosa deep to the staples en face. If the lesion is close to the margin, amputate the staples just below them and ink the exposed margin a color and with care to avoid ink running down the specimen. Section the specimen perpendicular to the staple line and observe the relationships of the lesion to the gastric wall, the color, consistency and shape of the lesion and relationships to the adjacent tissues and surfaces. Rinse the mucosa gently and describe the mucosal surface. Identify the lesion, measure in three dimensions and the distance to the margin. Describe where the lesion is located and which layers of the gastric wall the lesion is into and/or through. Note the percentage of necrosis in the gross as it is an important detail in staging these specimens. Describe the remaining uninvolved tissue if any. This can include the pliability of the wall and average thickness throughout. The wall pliability can be best assessed with physical manipulation throughout the specimen. Submit entirely if small, otherwise 1/cm is typical to include lesion to the layers of the wall, serosa, mucosa, and resection margin(s). Search attached soft tissue for possible lymph nodes and submit any/all that are identified. Description Perhaps the most interesting aspect of these specimens is that GIST/neuroendocrine tumors of the stomach are not a mucosal based tumor and often the mucosa is uninvolved. These typically arise from within the wall and grow towards the mucosa so examining the mucosal surface is still important for the final diagnosis. Often these do not have associated lymph nodes and attached omentum, but if it is present a search for lymph nodes is still appropriate.\nSections for Histology: •\t1/cm of lesion including capturing necrosis within the lesion •\tMargin(s) Dragon Template: “Wedge Stomach” Dictation Example: Received in a formalin container labeled \u0026ldquo;[patient\u0026rsquo;s name/MRN/site]\u0026rdquo; is a stomach wedge resection specimen, [# x # x #] cm, with [staples or cautery] across the resection margin which is inked [black].

If disrupted is this due to surgical manipulation in the operating room or is it because it was perforated or ruptured prior to surgery? This is a distinction that should be noted. The serosa should be smooth and glistening and may have subserosal fat deposition. The adventitial surface should be rough/cauterized but homogeneous in appearance. If there are surgical disruptions, they would be most likely in this area when separating the gallbladder from the liver. Note if there is a lymph node adjacent to the cystic duct, and whether the cystic duct is open, closed by a clip, obstructed by a calculus/tumor. The cystic duct margin should be inked after the staples/clip is removed. This can be amputated and submitted en face in the cassette. Open parallel to the long axis and note the contents of the gallbladder both the liquid and if there are calculi. The liquid may be clear, green, yellow, red, and tenacious, gelatinous, viscous, water-like, and blood. It is important to note the color, consistency, and rough number (one-ten, or multiple, or numerous, innumerable) of calculi and their +/- presence obstructing the cystic duct. The color and appearance of the calculi can help identify what they are made of. Gently remove the contents of the gallbladder to examine the mucosal surface. Is the mucosal surface intact? What color? Does it have yellow stippling or a polyp? If it appears green, it is bile stained and not a green velvety surface. Note disruptions in your gross. While most are removed for benign disease; always look for unsuspected neoplastic disease. Is the wall uniformly \u0026lt;0.4cm? Sample an area of the fundus and one of the body. Each strip can be approximately 1 x 0.3 cm. If no, or just an area is \u0026gt;0.4 cm, sample the wall more extensively and add additional cassettes to accommodate the additional sampling. Description: The most common reasons to receive gallbladders in the gross room are inflammation, bile stasis, obstruction, or may be incidental in the case of complex resections. Neoplasia is not commonly associated with these, but it cannot be overlooked or excluded.

If there are ANY outstanding questions regarding how the specimen was received, pertinent measurements, appearance, relationships, if it was intact or disrupted and what was frozen if it is not clear you MUST follow up with the responsible individuals or ask a PA for assistance. Not asking for clarification or doing some investigation is not acceptable. If the specimen is not inked and opened, ink the radial esophageal margin and any puckering or abnormality on the serosal surface of the stomach. The serosal surface does not need to be inked because it will rub off. If there is puckering or exposed tumor the ink will stick to those abnormalities. Open the specimen to avoid the lesion (use a finger to probe and identify the lesion prior to cutting that area). It is most common to open along the greater curvature, but if the lesion is in the way, this can be modified. If the lesion is cut into that is ok as it may be not palpable or circumferential. If it is bisected remember to add both sides together for the measurement. Grossly determine from which structure the tumor arises: is it gastric, gastroesophageal junctional, or esophageal in origin. To do this, examine the appearance of the tumor and its relationship (i.e., tumor epicenter) to the gastroesophageal junction. Measure the distance of the tumor’s epicenter from the gastroesophageal junction. Describe the lesion along with its dimensions and distances to the proximal, distal, and radial/deep margin.
