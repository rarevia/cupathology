### Procedure
Specimens include:
- uterus
- cervix
- vagina

The pelvic exenteration can be designated as:
- anterior: if bladder is included
- posterior: if rectum is included
- total: has both bladder and rectum included

It is important to show the relationships of the cervical or vaginal tumor with all the structures present in the specimen. Attending **MUST** lay eyes on these specimens.

### Gross description
-	Identify and measure each organ present
- Shave the vaginal, ureteral, and urethral margins
-	Inflate the bladder with formalin
-	Fill the vagina with formalin soaked gauze; then, allow it to fix
-	After fixation, bisect the specimen down the center into right and left halves
-	Look for nodes in the paracervical tissues and submit them

### Sections for histology
- Cervical tumor and its relationship to paracervical soft tissues, vagina, bladder and rectum.
- Standard sections of:
  - endomyometrium
  - ovary and tubes
- All lymph nodes and remaining fibroadipose tissue (up to 10 cassettes total)
- All margins:
  - bilateral ureters,
  - urethra,
