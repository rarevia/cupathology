## Radical Hysterectomy for Cervical Cancer

### Gross description
- Orient the uterus, weigh it, and differentially ink the anterior/posterior surfaces including the parametrial soft tissue
- Remove the parametrial tissue, perpendicularly section it, and submit each side (right, left) entirely (NOT JUST THE MARGINS)
-	Amputate the cervix and open it as you would a cone biopsy:
    - Describe the tumor
    - Measure the maximum tumor width, length and distance to nearest cervical margin and vaginal margin
-	Examine the vaginal cuff:
    - If tumor is < 1 cm from the cuff, submit perpendicular sections of the tumor with margin
    - If tumor is > 1 cm from the cuff, submit shave margins
-	Section the cervix longitudinally at 3 mm intervals and describe tumor depth:
    - Measure maximum wall thickness in this area
-	If prior therapy has been done, no gross tumor may be seen
-	Cut the uterus into anterior and posterior halves:
    - Make transverse sections to examine the endometrium and myometrium
-	Take gross photos, ideally including a cross section of tumor

### Sections for histology
#### Cervix
-	Parametrial tissue: collect bilateral samples and place in separate cassettes
-	If gross tumor is present:
    - 3 slices of tissue with full wall thickness in the deepest areas of invasion
    - 1 slice of uninvolved cervix (always designate o’clock position so that tumor size can be reconstructed at sign-out)
        - Cervical cancer staging rests upon precise tumor measurements in multiple dimensions
    - Consider **annotating a gross photograph** so that it is obvious where each section came from
    - Make sure there is **at least 1 section per cm** of tumor
-	If no gross tumor present (e.g., after a cold knife cone):
    - Entire cervix needs to be amputated and submitted radially (just like a cervical cone)

#### Uterine corpus
-	2 transverse sections of **lower uterine segment**
-	Full-thickness **anterior** and **posterior** endomyometrium in 1 cassette each

#### Bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries
-	If grossly normal, submit:
    - 1 cassette containing the left ovary
    - 1 cassette containing the right ovary
-	Submit the entire fimbriated ends of the fallopian tubes (perpendicularly sectioned) and at least 1 representative cross-section, separating left from right

#### Lymph nodes
-	For small nodes that will fix well, multiple per cassette submitted in toto **OR** nodes inked and bisected (so we can tell microscopically which pieces of nodes belong together)
    - A good rule of thumb is to bisect lymph nodes if they are > 0.3 cm in greatest dimension
-	If the node is very fatty, make sure it is sectioned THINLY
-	Submit extra fibroadipose tissue (up to 10 cassettes total)

### Example final gross report
The specimen is received fresh for intraoperative consultation, labeled "\[name / MRN / uterus, bilateral ovaries and fallopian tubes\]".

- Left fallopian tube: 4 x 0.6 cm, without fimbriated end, without paratubal cysts

The anterior surface is inked blue and the posterior inked black.
The bilateral parametria are removed and perpendicularly sectioned.
The cervix is amputated and radially sectioned. The remaining uterus is bivalved.

- Endometrial thickness:  0.2 cm
- Myometrial thickness:  1.3 cm

- Cervical mass: 2.2 x 1.2 x 0.5 cm, white-tan, involving the ectocervix and lower endocervical canal, present from 12 to 7 o’clock, located 0.7 cm from the ectocervical margin and 0.4 cm from the deep/stromal margin. The tumor invades to a maximal depth of 0.7 cm in an area where the cervical wall thickness is 1.1 cm.
- Other uterine findings: Multiple white, whorled myometrial nodules up to 0.9 cm diameter
- Additional masses or lesions are not identified. The uninvolved endocervical canal is tan and glistening. The tumor does not involve the lower uterine segment or endometrial cavity. The endometrium is tan-pink and smooth. The bilateral adnexa are unremarkable.
