## Radical Hysterectomy for Endometrial Hyperplasia

### Gross description
- Orient the uterus and weigh it
- Ink the:
    - anterior and posterior resection margins (not the serosa)
    - parametrial tissue (only if present; will only be there for radical hysterectomy specimens)
- Remove the bilateral parametrial/paracervical tissues (if present, usually only in cervical cancer cases) and perpendicularly section
- Bivalve the uterus and take a gross photograph
- Examine the cavity and mucosa and describe any lesions present
    - Record the size, location, and appearance of the tumor
    - Serially section the entire endometrial cavity and describe the pattern of invasion (pushing, infiltrative, or discontinuous?)
    - Measure the greatest depth of invasion and the maximum myometrial thickness in this area
- Each case must have an average (uninvolved) endometrial thickness and myometrial thickness recorded
- Take gross photos, including a cross section of tumor

### Sections for histology
#### Cervix
- If the cervix is normal and there is no history of dysplasia:
    - Take one section each of anterior and posterior cervix to include the squamocolumnar junction
- If there is a concurrent history of dysplasia:
    - 1 section per quadrant

#### Uterine corpus
-	Lower anterior uterine segment:
        - 1 longitudinal section each of **anterior** and **posterior**, noting if there is tumor involvement
-	Uterine body:
    - Frozen section remnant
    - Pilot tumor section (this only needs to be done if submission of sections is on the day following receipt of the specimen)
      - If the specimen is received and completely grossed/submitted on the same day, no "pilot" is needed
      - Bilateral parametria (if present), serially sectioned and submitted entirely, separating left from right
    - Tumor:
      - Submit 2 full thickness slices of the uterine wall in the area where the tumor appears the deepest and
      - 2 additional superficial sections of tumor
      - Submit additional sections of tumor such that you have at least 1 section of tumor per cm (if tumor is >4 cm)
      - Uninvolved endomyometrium:
         - 1 full thickness section each of anterior and posterior endomyometrium to demonstrate histology away from the tumor
    - If there is no lesion grossly visible:
      - Submit 1 full thickness section each of the anterior and posterior endomyometrium,
      - Then, submit the remainder of the endometrium in superficial strips (usually 2-3/cassette)
         - These should be deep enough to include the endomyometrial junction, but not the entire myometrium

#### Bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries
-	If grossly normal, submit:
    - 1 cassette containing the left ovary
    - 1 cassette containing the right ovary
-	Submit the entire fimbriated ends of the fallopian tubes (perpendicularly sectioned) and at least 1 representative cross-section, separating left from right

#### Lymph nodes
- For small nodes that will fix well, multiple per cassette submitted in toto **OR** nodes inked and bisected (so we can tell microscopically which pieces of nodes belong together)
    - A good rule of thumb is to bisect lymph nodes if they are > 0.3 cm in greatest dimension
- If the node is very fatty, make sure it is sectioned THINLY
- All sentinel lymph nodes need to be sectioned at 2 mm intervals and entirely submitted
- We often receive sentinel nodes for endometrial cancer. In CoPath, these will be accessioned as a “lymph node, sentinel (GYN)” and have “SNE” on the cassette. The SNE protocol should be indicated on all blocks of lymph node and not on remaining adipose that is submitted.  The protocol and stains should be copied to all additional lymph node blocks in addition to the “SNE” code on the block, but only 1 H&E assigned to the block that the remaining adipose tissue is in (if submitted).
- Submit extra fibroadipose tissue (up to 10 cassettes total)
