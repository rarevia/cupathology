## Radical Hysterectomy for Prolapse, Leiomyoma, Benign

### Gross description
- Weigh and measure the uterus and cervix and examine the serosa
- Orient the uterus (anterior to posterior {{<math>}}$\rightarrow${{</math>}} RFO \[round ligament, fallopian tubes, ovaries\]).
  - The peritoneum on the anterior uterine surface typically ends higher than on the posterior surface (due to the bladder)
  - Differentially ink the anterior and posterior resection margins (not the uterine serosa)
- Place a probe or forceps into the uterus
  - Bivalve the uterus into anterior and posterior halves
- Longitudinally section the endocervical canal to examine the transformation zone
- Serially section the uterus at 4 to 5 mm intervals and examine the slices for lesions
- Note in gross description if there are fimbriated vs non-fimbriated fallopian tubes

### Sections for histology
#### Cervix
- Anterior and posterior cervix:
  - 1 cassette each, to include squamocolumnar junction

#### Uterine corpus
- Full thickness anterior and posterior endomyometrium, 1 cassette each
- Representative sections of leiomyomas, especially the largest one
  - For each leiomyoma > 5 cm without evidence of necrosis or hemorrhage:
    - 1 section in 1 cassette
  - If none are larger than 5 cm:
    - Submit up to 5 cassettes, representatively sampling the lesions
  - Submit additional sections from lesions with grossly visible degeneration, hemorrhage, cysts, or necrosis
  - If hysterectomy/myomectomy is fragmented to the extent that there are no recognizable intact masses:
    - Submit 1 section/cassette per 1 cm (up to 10 cassettes)
- Representative sections of any intracavitary lesions (polyp, cyst)
- If the patient has a history of **BRCA mutation**, **Lynch syndrome**, or **abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB)** and no lesions (polyp, leiomyoma) are present:
  - Submit the entire endomyometrium as superficial slices (after taking 1 full-thickness section anterior/posterior)
- Do not need to submit entire endometrium for a history of breast cancer *without* a gene mutation

#### Bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries
-	If grossly normal, submit:
    - 1 cassette containing the left ovary
    - 1 cassette containing the right ovary
-	Submit the entire fimbriated ends of the fallopian tubes (perpendicularly sectioned) and at least 1 representative cross-section, separating left from right
