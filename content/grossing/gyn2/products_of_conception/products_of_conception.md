## Frequently Asked Questions About POCs
*Grossing*
- **Q** For standard cases with fetal tissue that are not specified as “gross eval only” by the patient, can the attending choose to make the case a gross only?
  - **A** Yes, absolutely. In this case, gross photos are required, as this is the only evidence we will have that we examined this case. It is best to check with the attending on service before grossing. As a default, submit a few sections for microscopic review. 
- **Q** For cases with fetal and placental tissue that are specified as “gross eval only” by the patient, should we submit placental tissue for microscopic review?
  - **A** This is case dependent and ultimately up to the attending. The “gross eval only” is understood to apply to fetal tissue only. It is best to check the clinical history for any concern for placental pathology and/or to check with the attending on service before grossing. As a default, submit a few sections of placenta for microscopic review. 
- **Q** How much detail should be included in the Gross Description of the final report for a case with fetal tissue?
  - **A** This is very much case dependent and attending discretion is required. In certain cases it may be appropriate for the attending to change the gross description to simply read “fetal and placental tissue present”
 
*Reporting*
- **Q** How much detail should be included in the Final Diagnosis for a case with fetal tissue?
  - **A** This is very much case dependent and attending discretion is required. The goal is to try to provide a level of detail commensurate with patient desire; a quick review of the clinical history/EPIC notes usually will suffice, but an email to the clinician can be very helpful in questionable cases. The default, per clinician-pathologist discussions, is to provide minimal detail. For cases with suspected anomaly, it is appropriate to list the anomalies in the Final Diagnosis. Please avoid use of the word “fragmented” (as in “fragmented fetal parts”) and other gratuitous graphic detail, including within the gross description.
  
### Examples of Final Diagnoses:  
 Uterine contents:
- Placental and fetal tissue (gross evaluation only)

 Uterine contents:
- Placental and fetal tissue

Uterine contents:
- Fetus (\_\_\_ weeks gestational age based on foot length = \_\_\_ cm)
- Immature placental tissue with \_\_\_
- (Listing of additional anomalies where indicated interest by clinicians)

### Prodcuts of Conception:
- Spontaneous abortions (SABs) - including first trimester “losses” (missed abortions, empty sacs, blighted ovum), second trimester miscarriages (incompetent cervix, preterm labor, intrauterine fetal demise)
- Therapeutic abortions (TABs) - which are induced procedures for a variety of reasons including:
  - Social (maternal request for legal termination of pregnancy)
  - Maternal indications (severe diseases exacerbated by pregnancy)
  - Fetal indications (structural or chromosomal anomalies)
- Rule out ectopic pregnancies - generally a first trimester pregnancy with pain and bleeding and an abnormal rise or fall in the serum bHcg levels
- Indicate in your block summary what percentage of specimen has been submitted 
  - e.g., The specimen is 40% submitted in (A1-A4), etc.
- For fetal remains cases, please do not cut/submit the fetal hearts unless you have evaluated it with an attending/experienced PA first. 
  - In an ideal world, please look up if there are expected cardiac anomalies, and if so, call the attending/PA to come gross the heart with you. If you cannot find anything in the chart referencing a suspected cardiac anomaly, please DO NOT cut/submit the heart at all/no need to call attending; but do continue with grossing the rest of the case as usual. We are trying to avoid cutting/submitting a heart from a suspected cardiac anomaly case such that we can then no longer evaluate for that anomaly.
- For fetal remains cases, avoid providing excessive/graphic detail in gross descriptions beyond what is suggested in the gross templates below. For cases in which we are doing an autopsy exam on surgical pathology, you may need to provide external measurements or internal organ weights. Check with your attending for how detailed to be in your exam.

### Timetable of Morphogenesis:
| Feature | Gestational Age |
| --- | --- |
| Upper limb bud | Week 6 |
| Paddle-shaped hand; lower limb bud | Week 7 |
| Palate closes | Week 7 |
| Paddle-shaped foot; elbow; retinal pigmentation | Week 8 |
| Gut in cord; eyelid; finger rays | Week 9 |
| Fingers; perforate anus; ambiguous external genitalia | Week 10 |
| Return of intestines to abdomen; eyelids fuse | Week 10-11 |
| Gender unequivocally determinable by external exam  | Week 12-13 |

### Sample Dictations: 
#### No villi: 
Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and medical record number and "POC" is \[\_\_\_x\_\_\_x\_\_\_\] cm of blood and scant pink/red soft tissue. Villous, membranous, or fetal/embryonic tissue is not identified grossly. The specimen is submitted ENTIRELY in cassettes (A1-A__).

(Note - If it's going to take > 6 cassettes to submit all the tissue, call your attending)

#### Villi present / no fetal parts:
Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and medical record number and consists of a soft tissue aggregate measuring \[\_\_\_x\_\_\_x\_\_\_\] cm. Villi are identified grossly and are not hydropic. Pink/tan soft tissue consistent with decidua and blood clot is identified. Representative sections (\_\_\_% of specimen) are submitted in cassettes (A1-A3)

#### Fetal parts present (Fragmented): 
*Please do not provide excessive additional/graphic detail about fetal parts unless specifically indicated for the case.*

Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and medical record number and consists of fetal and placental tissue measuring in aggregate \[\_\_\_x\_\_\_x\_\_\_\] cm. Two upper extremities are present; the hands each contain \[\_\_\_\] digits with nails and normal palmar creases. There is no poly or syndactyly. Two lower extremities are present; the feet contain \[\_\_\_\] digits each without poly or syndactyly. The foot length is \[\_\_\_\] cm. Villous and membranous tissues are identified and are not hydropic. There is a \[\_\_\_\] cm portion of a three vessel umbilical cord present. Various other pink/tan soft tissues are present consistent with decidua. Representative sections (\_\_\_% of specimen) are submitted in cassettes (A1-A\_). 

#### Fetal parts present (Intact):
*Cases for which the patient/clinician do NOT desire extensive detail*

Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and medical record number and consists of a phenotypically \_\_\_ fetus weighing \[\_\_\_\] grams. The umbilical cord is separate from the fragmented placenta and measures \[\_\_\_\] cm.  The umbilical cord has three vessels and is normal. The fragmented immature placental tissue measures in aggregate \[\_\_\_x\_\_\_x\_\_\_\] cm and is grossly unremarkable. The fetus is grossly unremarkable with a foot length of \[\_\_\_\] cm.

#### Fetal parts present (Intact):
*Pseudo-autopsy style, cases for which the patient/clinician seemingly desire extensive detail*

Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and medical record number and consists of a phenotypically \_\_\_ fetus weighing \[\_\_\_\] grams. The umbilical cord is separate from the fragmented placenta and measures \[\_\_\_\] cm.  The umbilical cord has three vessels and appears dusky but otherwise normal. The fragmented immature placental tissue measures in aggregate [\_\_\_x\_\_\_x\_\_\_\] cm and is grossly unremarkable. The fetus is grossly unremarkable, however the skin has been focally macerated and is easily sloughed off. The head is well formed with minimal procedural artifact. The eyes are closed and the palpebrae are fused, the mouth is normal and has a fused palate. The neck is normal without nuchal thickening. Two nipple buds are present and the trunk is grossly unremarkable. The external genitalia are \[\_\_\_\] and appear normal. The anus is patent. The vertebral column is intact. The extremities are well formed with five digits on each hand and foot and with no abnormal creases or contractures and a foot length of \[\_\_\_\] cm. Opening the thorax and abdomen reveals normal situs: the heart points to the left, the left lung has two lobes, the right lung has three lobes, the liver is in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, the spleen and stomach are in the left upper abdominal quadrant, the appendix is in the right side of the abdomen. The thymus is mediastinal. There are no fluid collections. The GI tract is normally rotated without atresias or strictures. There is a gallbladder on the right side of the liver. There are two retroperitoneal kidneys normally lobulated and two adrenal glands. The internal genitalia are normal \_\_\_.  

Representative sections are submitted as follows:</br>
(A1-A2) Placental tissue and umbilical cord</br>
(A3-A5) Fetal tissue</br>
(Note - if the procedure was done for a fetal anomaly, also give organ weights for lungs, heart, liver, kidneys)
