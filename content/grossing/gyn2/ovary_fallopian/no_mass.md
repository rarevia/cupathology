## Ovaries and Fallopian Tubes Without Masses
Ovaries and fallopian tubes may be submitted for the following reasons:
- As a risk reduction measure because the patient has a germline genetic mutation associated with an increased risk for cancer:
  - Formal SEE-FIM protocol required:
    - BRCA1
    - BRCA2
    - Other germline mutation
  - Not necessary to perform SEE-FIM protocol:
    - Lynch syndrome
    - History of breast cancer
- There is concern for ectopic pregnancy
- The patient desires permanent contraception

## Risk Reduction
Risk reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO)/prophylactic salpingo-oophorectomy (SEE-FIM Protocol) (usually for BRCA, or other high risk ovarian/breast cancer germline mutation)

Procedure for grossing OVARIES from prophylactic salpingo-oophorectomy specimens:
- Section the ovaries at 2-3 mm intervals PERPENDICULAR to the long axis and submit entirely
- Handle the ovaries as little as possible; we're looking for subtle changes in the surface epithelium, which is easily disrupted by lots of touching

Procedure for grossing FALLOPIAN TUBES from prophylactic salpingo-oophorectomy specimens:
- Measure and describe the tubes
- Detach the fimbriated ends
- Cross section the length of the tube at 2-3 mm intervals
- Divide the fimbriated ends into 3 longitudinal sections each
- Submit the right and left sides in toto in separate cassettes

### Risk-Reducing Ovary and Fallopian Tube Dictation Template:
The specimen is received \[fresh / for intraoperative consultation / in formalin\], labeled "\[name / MRN / designation\]".

- Ovary: \[\] g, \[\] cm
- Ovarian surface: \[Intact / Disrupted / Fragmented\], \[with / without\] surface adhesions
- Fallopian tube: \[\] cm length x \[\] cm diameter, \[with / without\] fimbriated end, \[with / without\] paratubal cysts up to \[\] cm diameter
- Gross abnormalities/additional findings: \[\]

The specimen is submitted entirely as follows:
\[\] Ovary, transversely sectioned
\[\] Fallopian tube, with perpendicularly sectioned fimbriated end, entirely submitted

### Example Risk-Reducing Ovary and Fallopian Tube Dictation:
The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "\[name / MRN / designation\]".

- Ovary: 10 g, 3 x 2 x 2 cm
- Ovarian surface: Intact, without surface adhesions
- Fallopian tube: 6 cm length x 0.7 cm diameter, with fimbriated end, without paratubal cysts
- Additional findings: 0.5 x 0.2 cm yellow nodule suggestive of corpus luteum

The specimen is submitted entirely as follows:</br>
(A1-A3) Ovary, transversely sectioned</br>
(A4-A6) Fallopian tube, with perpendicularly sectioned fimbriated end, entirely submitted

## Ectopic Pregnancy
### Gross Description:
- Note length and greatest diameter of each tube
- Describe the serosa. Is there fibrin, hemorrhage or adhesions to other organs?
- Describe the wall. Is it abnormally thick or ruptured?
- Describe the lumen. Patent, dilated, and the diameter if abnormally large.
- Note any masses. Include size, appearance and invasion.
- Note hyperemia, cysts and nodules of endometriosis. Describe cysts including diameter, thickness of wall, content and sessile or pedunculated.
- In the case of suspected ectopic pregnancy note if there is an embryo or placenta identified and the amount of hemorrhage and/or rupture.

### Sections for Histology:
- Incidental tubes without abnormalities:
  - Submit three cross sections of each tube (proximal, mid and distal), in one cassette for each tube.
  - Submit entire fimbria
- Suspected ectopic pregnancy:
  - Any tissue with gross appearance of products of conception (e.g., an embryo, villous tissue)
  - If none is grossly identified, submit several sections from the wall in the area of hemorrhage as well as several from the luminal clot
  - Additional sections should be submitted if products of conception are not identified microscopically
  - Submit entire fimbria
- Tubes with lesions:
  - Material adequate to evaluate abnormal area
  - At least three sections to include grossly uninvolved mucosa
  - Submit entire fimbria

## Ligation
### Gross Description:
- Length and diameter of each specimen, note whether a lumen is visible
- Note whether fimbria are present or not
  
### Sections for Histology:
- Submit entirely in cross section (no more than 3 per cassette) - we need to document complete cross section
- If present, submit entire fimbria.

### Sample Dictation:
Received in formalin labeled with the \[patient's name / medical record number / "\_\_\_"\] is a \[\_\_\_x\_\_\_\] cm non-fimbriated tubular segment of tan-brown tissue with a smooth and glistening/dull serosal surface. No masses or other lesions are identified (or describe). The specimen is serially sectioned revealing a pinpoint lumen and is submitted entirely in cassette (\_\_\_).
