### Gross Description
- Measure the size and weigh the specimen. Identify the fallopian tube
- Examine if the surface is intact, has adhesions, are there any irregularities or protuberances?  Surface lesions must be grossly and microscopically documented.
- Open the specimen in a sink to avoid splashing. Note the color and consistency of the contents: watery, bloody, mucoid, fatty, hair etc.  If cystic, is it unilocular or multilocular?
- Examine the inner surface. If there are any excrescences or thickened areas of the wall these should be frozen and further sampled for permanents.
- Note in gross description if fimbriated vs non-fimbriated fallopian tube.  
- If any of the above is not apparent because the specimen was opened by someone else for intraoperative diagnosis, ask that person.
- Take gross photos, including a cross section of tumor

### Sections for Histology:
- One section per centimeter of tumor (except mucinous, which needs 2 sections per centimeter). Focus on solid, papillary and cystic areas. State which cassettes contain tumor in relation to ovarian surface.

{{< callout context="caution" title="Caution" icon="outline/alert-triangle" >}}
Mucinous tumors require 2 sections per centimeter.

Other tumors require 1 section per centimeter.
{{< /callout >}}

- Submit at least 1 dedicated section of “ovarian surface tumor involvement” (could be surface excrescences) OR if not present, then “possible surface tumor involvement,” OR if not present, then “tumor closest to ovarian surface.”
- Submit left and right fallopian tubes, > 1 representative cross sections, and entire fimbriae, perpendicularly sectioned
- Residual ovary if present

#### Omentum
- If a grossly visible nodule measuring greater than 2 centimeters is present then just 2 sections of that nodule are sufficient
- If multiple nodules are present, all under two centimeters, submit two cassettes sampling different nodules
- If no gross abnormalities seen, submit 5 cassettes containing two sections each

#### Lymph Nodes
- For small nodes that will fix well, multiple per cassette submitted in toto OR nodes inked and bisected (so we can tell microscopically which pieces of nodes belong together)
- Submit extra fibroadipose tissue, up to 10 cassettes total for that part

### Dictation template

- Ovary: \[\_\_\_\] g, \[\_\_\_\] cm
- Ovarian surface: \[Intact / Disrupted / Fragmented\], \[with / without\] tumor involvement, \[with / without\] surface adhesions
- Fallopian tube: \[\_\_\_\] cm length x \[\_\_\_\] cm diameter, \[with / without\] fimbriated end, \[with / without\] paratubal cysts up to \[\_\_\_\] cm diameter, \[with / without\] tumor involvement
- Gross abnormalities: \[description/size of mass/organs involved/pertinent negatives, ex “tumor is limited to the ovary” or “no tumor is present beyond the ovary”\]

### Example report
The specimen is received for intraoperative consultation, labeled “name/MRN/right ovary and fallopian tube”.

- Ovary: 320 g, 12 x 10 x 7 cm
- Ovarian surface: Intact, without tumor involvement, with red-brown surface adhesions
- Fallopian tube: 6 cm length x 0.5 cm diameter, with fimbriated end, with paratubal cysts up to 0.5 cm diameter, with tumor involvement
- Gross abnormalities: Solid and cystic mass (12 x 9 x 7 cm) occupies 90% of the ovary, with tan-brown papillary excrescences throughout and red-tinged serous fluid. Extensive necrosis noted. The fallopian tube has a tan, firm 0.5 cm nodule on the serosa. No additional masses or lesions are identified.
