One of the main reasons we examine these placentas is to determine zygosity from placentation. This is possible only in monochorionic placentation (all monochorionic placentas arise from a single fertilized ova = monozygous; dichorionic placentation can arise from either dizygous or monozygous gestations). Therefore IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO OBTAIN A GOOD SAMPLE OF DIVIDING MEMBRANES AND A CLEAR GROSS DESCRIPTION!

Dividing membranes come in 4 categories:
1. Two completely separate placentas (therefore dichorionic)
   - Handle each as a singleton placenta
   - No obvious dividing membrane will be present, and dividing membranes are not required in this scenario
2. Two placental discs which are held together by thick dividing membranes (difficult to read a ruler through the membrane). 
   - Describe the dividing membrane and where it inserts, but dictate the placentas separately, since one you've trimmed off the membranes, they will be completely separate discs
3. One fused placenta with a thin dividing membrane (easy to read a ruler through; monochorionic diamnionic) 
4. One fused placenta with no dividing membrane (monochorionic monoamnionic)
   - Dictate as a singleton with two umbilical cords

It is important to orient the placentas as to order of delivery. Generally there will be one cord clamp on the presenting twin and two on the non-presenting; alternatively, one clamp may be labeled “A” and the other “B”. This can vary though, be sure you dictate how the cords were oriented. If they were not oriented, dictate so and arbitrarily orient them. 

### Sections for Histology:
- Submit 2–3 sections of full-thickness parenchyma (trimmed to maximum thickness 3 mm), to include at least one section of grossly normal parenchyma and any lesions. 
  - One of these sections should be at or near the cord insertion site
  - Sections should NOT come from the periphery of the placental disc
- Submit 2 sections of umbilical cord (proximal and distal) and 2 membrane rolls from different sites
- For twin placentas, there needs to be:
  - 1 cassette with the dividing membrane as a roll and a sample of the T-zone underlying dividing membrane (usually 7 cassettes total)
