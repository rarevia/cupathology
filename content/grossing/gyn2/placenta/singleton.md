- Placentas are sent to us fresh, and formalin added upon receipt in pathology. Please be sure your gross addresses this (“received fresh and subsequently placed in formalin labeled………….)
- Placentas with clinical history that mentions post-partum hemorrhage (PPH) and/or manual removal – submit an additional 2 cassettes with 1-2 sections each of basal layer (superficial maternal surface) to look for placenta accreta. These sections should include areas of disruption as well as intact cotyledons.
- For any placenta with intrauterine fetal demise (IUFD), always submit 10 cassettes – 1 each umbilical cord and membranes (more if you see something unusual, obviously), and the remaining 8 for placental disc.
- Please be sure to measure placental discs in 3 dimensions. There have been cases where one of the dimensions has been cut off (the report has only shown X x X cm), so I’ve asked the transcriptionists to insert a blank/notify us so that it can be filled in appropriately.
- If you gross a specimen with a study sticker on the req/container (indicating that the specimen was handled/tissue taken prior to it coming to us), please take a gross photo; they are otherwise handled per our standard procedure. If there is any information on the container or requisition with weight and/or amount of tissue removed by research, please include in your gross. 
- When you have an (attached) umbilical cord with a **true** knot, submit your proximal/distal sections in separate cassettes, and designate which is in which cassette. Please take a gross photo of the true knot.
- If you are grossly concerned for anastomosis of vessels in a multiple gestation placenta, take pictures for documentation
- For a forked cord, state distance to disc edge, can take sections of both forks

### Gross Examination
1. Examine the membranes and cord:
   - Cord: 
     - How many vessels? 
     - Any nodules on the surface? 
     - Thrombi in the vessels? 
     - TRUE knots? 
     - Membranous or marginal insertion? 
     - Hematomas, cysts, aneurysms...
   - Membranes:
     - Color (green, brown, pink)
     - Transparency (can you see the fetal vessels on the chorionic plate clearly? can you read a ruler through the membranes easily?)
     - Nodules? yellow or white?
     - Insertion into disk: marginal, inside margin (circummarginate), inside margin with prominent fibrin deposition (circumvallate)
2. After measurements and examination, cut the cord off at the disc and take two sections of cord (proximal and distal).
   - Take TWO membrane rolls: one at the site of rupture (if identified) and one elsewhere. 
   - Cut a strip of membranes about 2 cm wide from the most distal portion of the disk. Include a small portion of disk margin. Wrap a "jelly roll" of membranes. Cut transversely and submit one section from each roll. Once the membrane rolls are done, trim the remaining membranes off the disc and then weigh and measure the disc.
3. Examine the placental disc:
   - After the placenta has been weighed, bread loaf the placenta at 1-2 cm intervals perpendicular to the maternal surface. 
   - Examine the parenchyma for infarcts, thrombi, cysts, masses, pallor, or other pathology. 
   - Examine the maternal floor for hematomas (fresh or organized) and/or excessive bandlike fibrin. 
   - Examine the fetal surface for discoloration, fibrin, nodules, cysts, or other pathology. 
   - Dictate findings including color and texture (red/boggy/beefy, pink/firm, etc.). 
   - Any of these abnormalities are what you will want to include in your 3 parenchyma sections. 
   - Try to stay away from the edge when taking the parenchymal sections unless it’s the site of a lesion/abnormality. 
   - Take one parenchymal section from at or near the cord insertion site and note in which cassette this is submitted.
