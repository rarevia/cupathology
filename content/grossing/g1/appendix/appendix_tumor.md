**CAP synoptic?** Appendix, NET; Appendix; GIST, Resection

## Example Headers:
Appendix, appendectomy

## Triage Needed:
None, if fresh (and no ancillary testing requested) can be put in formalin. Depending on arrival time into the lab, it may be best to measure and ink then let fix overnight. 

## Procedure: 
1. Always ink and sample the margin
2. Ink the entire exterior surface BEFORE sectioning
3. Look for and document the presence of extra-appendiceal mucin, both adherent to the appendix, and detached in the container
4. Amputate the staple line with 0.3 cm of tissue on it, then trim of that 0.3 cm, and ink the side closest to the staples and submit en face into your block
5. Serially section the appendix and describe the mucosal surface and luminal contents
6. Entirely and sequentially submit the appendix in its entirety. The mesoappendix does not need to be submitted unless involved.

## Description:
Mucin on the outer surface of the appendix is a prognostic and staging factor. The specimen MUST be inked prior to opening (if intact) to aid in identifying extra appendiceal mucin. If in doubt, ink it prior to opening- often for dilated appendices. In this case of possible malignancy, the entire tip should be submitted for routine histological evaluation.

## Sections for Histology:
- Inked base margin
- Mesoappendix margin (if necessary)
- Sequentially submitted cross sections
- Bisected/serially sectioned tip

## Dictation Example: 
Received in a formalin container labeled "[patient's name/ MRN/site]" is an [intact and dilated] vermiform appendix, [# x # x #] cm, with an attached mesoappendix and staples across the base margin which is inked [black]. The outer surface is inked [blue] prior to sectioning and the serosal surface is [smooth and glistening] with [no] extra-appendiceal mucin present. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal [mucin within the dilation, # x # x #] cm and the dilation is [#] cm from the stapled resection margin. The mucosal surface [is denuded at the area of dilation, but otherwise pink and unremarkable]. A gross photograph is taken. 

The appendix is entirely submitted as follows:</br>
([A1]) Inked base margin, en face</br>
([A2]-[A#]) Central cross sections proximal to distal</br>
([A#]) Bisected tip
