## Example Headers:
Appendix, appendectomy

## Triage Needed:
None, if fresh (and no ancillary testing requested) can be put in formalin.

## Procedure:
1. Describe measurements and appearance of the appendix noting any area of perforation or purulent material along the outer surface.
2. Remove the staples of the base margin (if present) and ink the margin black. If black is not used, note the color in the gross description to avoid confusion.
3. Serially section the appendix in 0.3 cm increments from the base to ~1cm from the tip and describe the mucosal surface and average wall thickness. Is it red, pink, denuded, a definite perforation in the wall? 
4. Describe contents of lumen 
5. Submit at least one half of the bisected distal tip (can submit both sides if space allows) along with the inked base margin and the area of the most significant pathology of the wall and lumen. IF there is a perforation or possible perforation it should be included in the representative section. 
6. If the specimen is removed for appendicitis or suspected appendicitis and no discrete findings are noted on the mucosa and otherwise looks unremarkable--- the entire appendix should be submitted up front. The mesoappendix does not need to be included in this sampling unless abnormality is noted. 
   
## Description:
Most are for benign disease; a more extensive description and sampling is required for neoplastic disease.  Always look for unsuspected neoplastic disease. If unremarkable and taken for appendicitis, submit all cross sections up front. 

## Sections for Histology:
- Inked base margin, en face
- ½ bisected tip (can put in both sides if space allows)
- Central cross section showing pathology
- If there is no discrete pathology, consider submitting entirely up front (vs going back)

## Dictation Example: 
Received in a formalin container labeled "[patient's name/ MRN/site]" is an [intact] vermiform appendix, [# x # x #] cm, with an attached mesoappendix and staples across the base margin which is inked [black].  The serosal surface is [smooth and glistening] and cut surfaces demonstrate [a denuded, red mucosa] with an average wall thickness of [#] cm. There is [no] [blood/fecal/purulent material] throughout the lumen.  Representative sections, including the inked base margin, bisected tip and representative cross section are submitted in ([A1]).
