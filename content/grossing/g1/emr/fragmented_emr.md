## Example Headers:
“Colon, transverse, polypectomy:” “Colon, transverse, endoscopic mucosal resection:”

## Triage Needed:
None, if fresh (and no ancillary testing requested) can be placed in formalin.

## Procedure: 
1. Take extreme care in deciding on the best way to section the specimen and recording the orientation for each block for the larger polyps and fragments
2. Choosing the best way to section the specimen usually involves a decision regarding the margin of most interest; in this case it is the deep resection margin
3. If an intact polyp is identified with a resection margin, this can be inked one color. If these specimens are fragmented there is no requirement for inking the margins
4. If inked, it should be bisected or sectioned to show the relationship of the polyp to the margin
5. Fragmented specimens should be submitted in ~6 pieces per cassette. Large fragments should be sectioned to fit in the cassettes. Small fragments can be poured into a bag.
6. Submit the specimen entirely for histologic examination

## Description: 
Even though these are generally small specimens, the evaluation of margins may be crucial for determining the necessity of further treatment in pedunculated polyps (e.g., segmental colectomy). 

To properly evaluate margins, the specimen must be meticulously grossed. Key points to grossing include noting whether a stalk is grossly identified, inking the grossly identified stalk margin, and taking a good section through the polyp’s stalk, if a stalk is identified. Often a good section through the polyp’s stalk is not a simple bisection but rather a single section containing the entirety of the stalk.

## Sections for Histology:
The specimen must be entirely submitted for microscopic examination.

## Dictation Example: 
Received in a formalin container labeled "[patient's name/MRN/site]" is [an intact/disrupted] [pedunculated/sessile] polyp, [x x x] cm, with a resection margin that is inked [black].  The specimen is serially sectioned and submitted entirely in ([A1]).
