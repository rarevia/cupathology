## Example Headers:
Colon, endoscopic mucosal resection:

## Triage Needed:
Fix in formalin for a couple of hours prior to sectioning. Fragmented specimens are covered under Polypectomy and Fragmented EMR/ CMR/ ESD Specimens. 

## Procedure: 
1. Take extreme care in deciding on the best way to section the specimen and recording the orientation for each block
2. Choosing the best way to section the specimen usually involves a decision regarding the margin of most interest (i.e., usually the one which appears to be closest to the grossly identified lesion); the cut “strips” can then be oriented to best capture the lesion in relation to this margin of interest.
3. Like a skin ellipse, the first and last of the “strips” is best evaluated by serially sectioning of these strips (see drawing below)
4. Submit entirely and sequentially

## Description: 
Even though these are generally small specimens, they are RESECTIONS for neoplastic disease and proper examination of margins is crucial.  They are also assigned to GI and NOT G2 even though if unoriented they will go to gross techs. 

## Sections for Histology: 
These specimens must be entirely submitted for microscopic examination while maintaining orientation and sequence of slices.

## Dictation Example: 
Received in a formalin container labeled “[patient’s name/MRN/site]" is an intact and oriented mucosal resection specimen, [# x # x #] cm, that is oriented as follows: [_].  The mucosa is remarkable for a [topographically irregular and nodular] lesion, [# x # x #] cm, which is [#] cm from the closest resection margin [(specify closest orientation, if any)].  The specimen is serially sectioned from [__] to [__] and submitted sequentially and entirely as follows:</br>

([A1]) [distal most / proximal most / _ o’clock] slice, perpendicularly sectioned</br>
([A2])-([A#]] central cross sections, ([A#-A#] contains the lesion)</br>
([A#]) [distal most / proximal most / _ o’clock] slice, perpendicularly sectioned
