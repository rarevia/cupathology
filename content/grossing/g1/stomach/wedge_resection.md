**CAP synoptic?** GIST for stomach

## Example Header:
Stomach, partial gastrectomy

## Triage Needed:
None, this specimen may need to be fixed overnight (but not always)

## Procedure:
1. State the condition of the stomach wedge and its overall size in three dimensions.
2. These specimens are usually unoriented, with staples across the resection margin and minimal omentum (if any). State this and if they appear different than the norm.
3. Describe the appearance of the serosal surface noting any irregularities or discolorations and ink them if they are present. If there are no abnormalities the serosa does not need to be inked.  
4. Open along the specimen staple line, 0.3 cm from the staple line if the lesion is palpated as far from the margin and submit the entire strip of mucosa deep to the staples en face. 
  -	If the lesion is close to the margin, amputate the staples just below them and ink the exposed margin a color and with care to avoid ink running down the specimen. 
5. Section the specimen perpendicular to the staple line and observe the relationships of the lesion to the gastric wall, the color, consistency and shape of the lesion and relationships to the adjacent tissues and surfaces.
6. Rinse the mucosa gently and describe the mucosal surface.
7. Identify the lesion, measure in three dimensions and the distance to the margin. Describe where the lesion is located and which layers of the gastric wall the lesion is into and/or through. 
   - Note the percentage of necrosis in the gross as it is an important detail in staging these specimens.
8. Describe the remaining uninvolved tissue if any. This can include the pliability of the wall and average thickness throughout. The wall pliability can be best assessed with physical manipulation throughout the specimen. 
9.  Submit entirely if small, otherwise 1/cm is typical to include lesion to the layers of the wall, serosa, mucosa, and resection margin(s).
10. Search attached soft tissue for possible lymph nodes and submit any/all that are identified. 

## Description
Perhaps the most interesting aspect of these specimens is that GIST/neuroendocrine tumors of the stomach are not a mucosal based tumor and often the mucosa is uninvolved. These typically arise from within the wall and grow towards the mucosa so examining the mucosal surface is still important for the final diagnosis. Often these do not have associated lymph nodes and attached omentum, but if it is present a search for lymph nodes is still appropriate.

## Sections for Histology:  
•	1/cm of lesion including capturing necrosis within the lesion
•	Margin(s)

Dictation Example: 
Received in a formalin container labeled "[patient's name/MRN/site]" is a stomach wedge resection specimen, [# x # x #] cm, with [staples or cautery] across the resection margin which is inked [black].  The serosal surface is [tan-pink and glistening].  Cut surfaces demonstrate a [well circumscribed white-tan, homogenous nodule], [# x # x #] cm arising from [within the gastric wall], [deep to] the serosa and [uninvolved] by the mucosa. The nodule has [multiple foci] of chalky discoloration accounting for approximately [20]% of the nodule. This nodule is [#] cm from the resection margin.  The mucosal surface is [red and tan with appropriate rugal folds and a pliable wall with an average thickness of 0.4 cm] and is [not] involved or adherent to the nodule.  [No] omentum or perigastric soft tissues are submitted with the resection and no lymph nodes are identified. A gross photograph is taken. The specimen is submitted entirely in ([A1]-[A6]).
