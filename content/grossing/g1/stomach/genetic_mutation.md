## Example Headers:
Stomach, gastrectomy

## Triage Needed:
Measurements, ink any serosal puckering, and open along the greater curvature unless lesion in the way (probe with finger prior to cutting). Pin the lesion area on corkboard. Often these are fixed overnight.

## Procedure:  
1. This prophylactic procedure should be a complete and intact gastrectomy specimen to prevent gastric carcinomas. If it is not complete- include in the gross description. Describe if the margins (proximal and distal) are stapled or open and its overall size in three dimensions. 
2. Describe the appearance of the serosal surface noting any irregularities or discolorations and ink them if necessary.
3. Open along the greater curvature and describe the contents. Once completed, rinse the mucosa gently and describe the mucosal surface, if there is an appropriate rugal folding pattern.
4. Look for any lesions, polyps or abnormalities. Note it is uncommon to find a significant lesion.
5. Note the pliability of the wall and average thickness throughout. The wall pliability can be best assessed with physical manipulation throughout the specimen.
6. Determine (with the help and guidance of an attending, fellow, senior resident or PA) the amount of specimen to submit and how to map using the photo software. Strips should be 3mm in thickness and either the length of the stomach (preference) or horizontal. The specimen needs to be submitted sequentially with some sort of organization. 
7. By sectioning into strips, the wall can be examined for abnormalities or lesions. Any lesions should be measured and the relationships to the margins should be described.
8. If the specimen is not submitted in its entirety- it should be sampled extensively and adequately to find individual cancer cells or groups. 
   
## Description:
Prophylactic gastrectomy specimens are recommended in the event of CDH1 mutations and identified familial predisposition. Almost all these cases do not have a lesion so sequential sampling with photo mapping is the best way to process these specimens. Lymph nodes can be submitted up front so going back to the bucket does not need to happen should carcinoma be found but is not required. 

## Sections for Histology:
If no distinct lesion or thickening is identified the specimen should be mapped and submitted entirely. *This is important to discuss with attending prior to grossing. Strategic sampling may be preferred. 

**Dictation Template:** “Gastric Mutant”

## Dictation Example: 
Received in formalin in a container labeled "[patient's name/MRN/site]" is a total gastrectomy specimen [# x # x #] cm, with stapled resection margins and [including a distal esophagus segment], [# x #] cm, which is inked [blue]. Along the greater and lesser curvatures pieces of omentum, averaging [# x # x #] cm which are yellow and lobulated and without lesion. The serosal surface is [smooth, glistening, and is not diffusely firm].  The specimen mucosa is [tan, brown with appropriate rugal folds]. There are [no discrete polyps or lesions].  The stomach is serially sectioned and submitted sequentially from [left to right] per the annotated photograph. Multiple possible lymph nodes are identified that range from [#] to [#] cm in greatest dimension and submitted entirely along with the entire stomach as follows:

([A1]) Proximal margin, en face</br>
([A2]) Distal margin, en face</br>
([A3]-[A#]) Stomach from [left] to [right], see annotated photograph</br>
([A#]-[A#]) [Lymph node candidates per cassette, specify]</br>
