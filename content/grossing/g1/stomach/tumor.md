Stomach, gastrectomy

## Triage Needed:
Measurements, ink any serosal puckering, and open along the greater curvature unless lesion in the way (probe with finger prior to cutting). Pin the lesion area on corkboard. Often these are fixed overnight.

## Procedure: 
1. These sepcimens often arrive fresh for frozen section diagnosis and or tissue banking. If there are ANY outstanding questions regarding how the specimen was received, pertinent measurements, appearance, relationships, if it was intact or disrupted and what was frozen if it is not clear you MUST follow up with the responsible individuals or ask a PA for assistance. Not asking for clarification or doing some investigation is not acceptable. 
2. If the specimen is not inked and opened, ink the radial esophageal margin and any puckering or abnormality on the serosal surface of the stomach. The serosal surface does not need to be inked because it will rub off. If there is puckering or exposed tumor the ink will stick to those abnormalities.
3. Open the specimen to avoid the lesion (use a finger to probe and identify the lesion prior to cutting that area). It is most common to open along the greater curvature, but if the lesion is in the way, this can be modified. If the lesion is cut into that is ok as it may be not palpable or circumferential. If it is bisected remember to add both sides together for the measurement. 
4. Grossly determine from which area of the stomach the tumor arises: To do this, examine the appearance of the tumor and its relationship (i.e. tumor epicenter) to the gastroesophageal junction.  If within 2 cm of the gastroesophageal junction, refer to the esophagus area of this document.
5. Describe the lesion along with its dimensions and distances to the proximal (possibly esophageal), distal, and radial/deep margin. Does the resection include the pyloric junction or not?
6. Describe the remaining mucosa both esophagus and stomach including any additional lesions or abnormalities.
7. Palpate the esophageal (if present) and stomach adipose for lymph node candidates. While 16 lymph nodes are the minimum to stage gastric carcinoma, do not stop at 16. ALL the lymph nodes must be identified and submitted.
   - If only a few were palpated and or at the direction of the attending or fellow- all periesophageal and peri gastric adipose can be submitted following the lymph node search for additional lymph node capture.

## Description:
Gastric cancer lymph nodes staging is based on the submission of at least 16 lymph nodes per CAP and >30 per AJCC should be submitted. Adipose may be submitted for possible additional lymph node capture AFTER a meticulous search for lymph nodes in the adipose. Mapping the submitted sections may be beneficial over just a gross photograph in the event of a diffuse type of carcinoma or no discrete lesion to confirm actual size of lesion following microscopy. 

## Sections for Histology:
- Margins (proximal and distal), each en face and entirely submitted
- Lesion 1/cm to include the greatest depth of invasion and distance to margin if appropriate
- Any additional areas of interest or abnormality
- Lymph nodes - **ALL of them**
  - If 30 high quality candidates are not identified - submit additional adipose for possible lymph node capture

## Dictation Example: 
Received [fresh for frozen section diagnosis, tissue banking and subsequently placed in formalin] labeled "[patient's name/MRN/site]" is a partial [proximal] gastrectomy specimen, [# x # x #]cm, with attached distal esophagus, [# x #] cm and inked [blue]. Yellow, lobulated, omentum is attached to the greater and lesser curvatures that averages [# x # x #] cm. The serosal surface is [smooth, glistening, and the wall is [not] diffusely firm.  The lumen contains minimal transparent mucinous fluid and no food material. Cut surfaces demonstrate a [tan] ulceration in the cardia, that is [#] cm from the proximal margin, [#] cm from the distal margin and [#] cm from the radial margin. The serosal surface over the identified ulceration is inked [black].  The ulceration invades [into but not through the muscularis propria] and does [not] involve the serosa. The remainder of the gastric mucosa is [tan-brown with appropriate rugal folds throughout] and no additional lesions are identified.  A gross photograph is taken. Multiple possible lymph nodes that are [#] to [#] cm in greatest dimension are identified and entirely submitted along with representative sections as follows:

([A1]) Proximal margin, en face</br>
([A2]) Distal margin, en face</br>
([A3]-[A#]) Tumor, including greatest depth of invasion</br>
([A#]-[A#]) Representative sections of uninvolved stomach</br>
([A#]-[A#]) [Lymph node candidates per cassette, specify]</br>
