## Notes:
Most common sites and subsites:
- Esophagus (upper, middle, lower third)
- Gastroesophageal (G-E) junction*
- Stomach (cardia, fundus, body, antrum)
- Duodenum (bulb, second, third, fourth part)
- Small Intestine (jejunum, terminal ileum*)
- Colon (cecum*, ascending, transverse, descending, sigmoid) 
- Rectum*
- Anus*</br>
*sites not subsites

## Header Notes:
- The requistion often **incorrectly** labels the site, so please do not repeat the error
- For example:
  - The gastroesophageal (G-E) junction is a **site**, *not a subsite* of the esophagus
  - The terminal ileum, cecum, rectum, and anus are **sites**, *not subsites* of the colon
- If more than one subsite is sampled from the same site, list the site followed by a comma and then the subsites
  - Example: Stomach, body and antrum, biopsy
  - Example: Colon, ascending, transverse, and descending, biopsy
- If more than one site is sampled in the same container, as are multiple subsites gets more cumbersome; try to make it simple. 
  - Example 1:
    - Requisition: "Major Site: Esophagus" and "Location: lower third, gastroesophageal junction" 
    - Header: “Lower third of the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction, biopsy:”
  - Example 2: 
    -	Requisition: "Major site: Colon" and "Location: cecum, ascending, transverse"
    - Header: “Cecum, ascending colon, and transverse colon, biopsy:”
  - Example 3:
    - Requisition: "Major site: Colon" and "Location: sigmoid and rectum"
    - Header: “Sigmoid colon and rectum, biopsy:”
- The most common procedures listed on the requisition include:
  - biopsy
  - polypectomy
  - endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR/CMR/ESD
-	The procedure is **always singular**
  - Example: use “biopsy” and never “biopsies”
-	The procedure is usually found on the requisition under “Maneuver”. This is not always correct, but it is the best starting point (e.g., sometimes an endoscopic mucosal resection is labeled as “polypectomy”); this might be indicated somewhere else on the requisition, usually in the "Impressions" section.

## Procedure: 
1. Scan case barcode into CoPath and PC Dictate
2. Dictate the case number, patient name and MRN
3. Scan the container barcode into CoPath and read the container and confirm it is correct and matches the information in CoPath and on the requisition.
4. Describe the specimen and pour contents into the correct number of bags to follow the ~6 pieces per cassette rule.
  - How specimen was received (fresh vs in formalin)
  - Count the number of pieces of tissue in each container (# > 10, use “multiple”)
  - Describe the tissue appearance (tan soft-tissue fragment is sufficient)
  - Measure the greatest dimension of the smallest and largest pieces of tissue
  - Provide a three-dimensional aggregate size of all tissues together
  - Submit entirely and limit to ~6 pieces of tissue per cassette
5. Place one bag in each cassette, and print additional cassettes as needed
6. Scan each of the cassettes in order and put them in the rack for holding

## Description:
Even though these are some of our smallest specimens, they are also some of the most important. These biopsies are taken for a variety of reasons including: first time diagnoses, surveillance, as a confirmatory test for some pathologies, and to determine how well a treatment is working. Tissues on the slide(s) are limited to around six so the pathologist does not become lost in the specimens on an overcrowded slide. This turns each slide into a manageable number of tissues to examine in a systematic manner. They are submitted entirely since they are taken from different locations throughout the area sampled and there are no margins or orientations to keep track of. 

## Sections for Histology:
Entirely submitted (majority of the time in toto)

## Dictation Template:
“GI [1-10]”

## Dictation Example: 
Received in a formalin container labeled “[patient’s Name/MRN/site]” [is a/are #] soft tan tissue[s] that are [# to #] cm in greatest dimension and [# x # x #]cm in aggregate. The specimen is submitted in toto in ([A]1).
