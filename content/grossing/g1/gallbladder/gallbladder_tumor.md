**CAP synoptic?** Gallbladder

**Example Header:** Gallbladder, cholecystectomy

## Triage Needed:
None, if fresh (and no ancillary testing requested) can be put in formalin.

## Procedure:
1. Assess if the specimen is intact or disrupted. If disrupted is this due to surgical manipulation in the operating room or is it because it was perforated or ruptured prior to surgery? This is a distinction that should be noted. 
2. The serosa should be smooth and glistening and may have subserosal fat deposition. The adventitial surface should be rough/cauterized but homogeneous in appearance. If there are surgical disruptions, they would be most likely in this area when separating the gallbladder from the liver.
3. Note if there is a lymph node adjacent to the cystic duct, and whether the cystic duct is open, closed by a clip, obstructed by a calculus/tumor. The cystic duct margin should be inked after the staples/clip is removed. This can be amputated and submitted en face in the cassette.
4. Prior to opening the specimen, the adventitial surface/liver parenchymal margin should also be inked (different color) as this is important for noting any extension into the liver. If there is roughening or puckering of the serosal surface this should also be noted and sampled. 
5. Open parallel to the long axis and note the contents of the gallbladder both the liquid and if there are calculi. The liquid may be clear, green, yellow, red, and tenacious, gelatinous, viscous, water-like, and blood. It is important to note the color, consistency, and rough number (one-ten, or multiple, or numerous, innumerable) of calculi and their +/- presence obstructing the cystic duct. The color and appearance of the calculi can help identify what they are made of.
6. Gently remove the contents of the gallbladder to examine the mucosal surface. Is the mucosal surface intact? What color? Does it have yellow stippling or a polyp? If it appears green, it is bile stained and not a green velvety surface. Note disruptions in your gross and take a gross photograph. 
7. Find the polyp or lesion. Note color, shape, size, consistency, location (fundus, body, duct, adventitial side, etc) and distance to the duct margin and the liver parenchymal margin (adventitial surface). 
8. Is the wall uniformly <0.4cm? Sample an area of the fundus and one of the body. Each strip can be approximately 1 x 0.3 cm.  If not, or an area is >0.4 cm, sample the wall more extensively and add additional cassettes to accommodate the additional sampling.
9. The lesion is usually be sampled entirely, but if it is large (>4 cassettes), confirm with attending, fellow, senior resident, or PA. When submitting a larger area, submit the slices sequentially and up to 3 sections per cassette.
    
## Description:
Carcinoma of the gallbladder is staged by depth of invasion and then into adjacent structures. The margins, depth of invasion, presence into/through the serosa, and parenchymal bed are used to stage these tumors.

## Sections for Histology: 
- Inked cystic duct margin, en face
- Lymph node if present
- Lesion to normal, serosa, adventitia (entirely submitted if possible)
- Section of uninvolved if any

## Dictation Example: 
Received in a formalin container labeled "[patient's name/MRN/site]" is an [intact/disrupted] saccular gallbladder, [# x # x #] cm. The serosal surface is [pink-purple, smooth, and glistening]. The cystic duct margin is inked [black], adventitial surface is inked [blue], and there is [no] appreciated cystic lymph node. The gallbladder contains [green tenacious] bile and has [multiple, yellow, bossellated calculi up to 0.8 cm in greatest dimension] [with/without] occlusion of the cystic duct. 

Cut surfaces demonstrate a [bile stained and velvety] mucosa with [a single, yellow, polyp], [# x # x #] cm that is [#] cm from the cystic duct margin. There [is/is not] associated induration of the mucosal wall spanning an area of [# x #] cm and is [at the adventitial surface and abuts the blue inked margin]. No additional lesions have been identified. A gross photograph of the mucosal surface and the lesion are taken. 

Representative sections including the entire area of induration are submitted as follows:
([A]1) Cystic duct margin, en face [and cystic node]</br>
([A2]-[A4]) Polyp and induration with relationship to the margin in [A4].</br>
([A5]) Representative body and fundus
