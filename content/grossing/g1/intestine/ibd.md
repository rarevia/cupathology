## Example Header:
Colon, total colectomy 

## Triage Needed:
The specimen needs to be opened anti-mesenterically (unless there is an obstruction), cleaned of debris, and fixed in formalin. Measurements and margins (if taken) should be documented on container or requisition.

## Procedure:
1. Measure the length and diameter range of all the components noting the presence or absence of the appendix for right hemicolectomy and total colectomy specimens. Once opened measure the range of bowel wall thicknesses especially when associated with any of the findings below.
2. Describe the serosal surface of the bowel, noting color, granularity, indurations, perforations, stricture, fistula, anastomoses, distribution of fat, and adhesions. 
3. Describe mucosal surface, noting color, ulcers, pseudopolyps, velvety or indurated areas, cobblestoning.
   - Measure the length, diameter or circumference, wall thickness, location (distance from the closest margin or ileocecal valve) and appearance of any stenosis/stricture. 
   - Describe the length, diameter, location, and appearance of fistula. 
4. Indicate extent of disease involvement, and whether it is diffuse, patchy, focal, or multifocal. Measure the length or area if focal disease and document the location (distance to closest margin or ileocecal valve).
5. Describe appearance of the mucosa at the resection margins
6. Palpate/dissect mesenteric tissue for lymph nodes, noting size and appearance of representative nodes
   - If no cancer identified or suspected, then a complete dissection is not necessary

## Description: 
Grossing IBD specimens is important for diagnosing and classifying the disease and comparing any progression that has happened since their prior surgery or biopsy. This also helps relieve symptoms for the patients to remove a segment of IBD colon. 

## Sections for Histology: 
- Marings (proximal, distal, and radial) en face
- Appendix, tip bisected, representative cross section (if attached)
- Any abnormalities/defects
- A couple sections per block at 10 cm intervals
- Sample of lymph nodes (if carcinoma is identified then a complete lymph node search is required)

## Dictation Example:
Received fresh labeled "[patients name/MRN/site]" is a segment of terminal ileum ([#] cm in length and [#] cm in diameter), colon ([#] cm in length and [#] cm in diameter), appendix ([#] cm in length and [#] cm in diameter)] that is [stapled/open] at each end. The [attached omentum/mesentery is up to #] cm in thickness and is [adhesed to itself to form a U-shaped portion of colon involving the transverse, descending and sigmoid colon]. The serosa has [multiple transmural ovoid defects ranging from 1.0-4.2 cm]. Creeping fat [is/is not] present. There are [multiple palpable lymph nodes within the adipose tissue  up to #] cm in greatest dimension. The appendix has a [tan-pink to red-brown, smooth and glistening serosal surface]. The lumen contains [tan-brown, soft fecal material] and there is a wall thickness of [0.2] cm [with/without] fecaliths. The mucosa of the colon is [red brown with diffuse discolored tan-green areas, pseudopolyps and ulcerations]. Uninvolved colon mucosa is [not] grossly identified. [The ileum mucosa is hyperemic and edematous with normal folds.] Distinct masses are [absent].
