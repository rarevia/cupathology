**CAP synoptic?** Yes 

## Example Headers:
Colon, right hemicolectomy

## Triage Needed:
The specimen needs to be opened anti-mesenterically (unless mass in the way), cleaned of debris, and fixed in formalin. If the mass is puckering or through the wall, ink over that area. Measurements, pilot section and margins (if taken) should be documented on container or requisition. A pilot section should be taken and submitted for processing to limit formalin exposure.

## Procedure: 
1. Describe and measure the overall specimen (separate between terminal ileum, appendix, and cecum with attached ascending colon) and how the margins appear (viable/ stapled/dusky/open/identified with a suture) and how the serosa looks. 
2. Since it should be triaged open, find, and describe the lesions appearance and size in two dimensions and note the distance to closest proximal and distal margins
3. Serially section lesion and measure depth of invasion and distance from the radial margin (non-peritonealized surface). Adjust the proximal and distal margins distances if needed.
4. Locate and note the presence/absence/appearance of the appendix and any involvement it has to the lesion.
5. Photograph cut surface at deepest point of invasion and mucosal surface if necessary
6. Submit 1/cm of lesion and include one of the greatest depth of invasion and/or an additional to the radial margin ink. If only a treated TUMOR BED is present, submit ENTIRELY.
7. Describe and submit any additional lesions or polyps
8. Palpate and dissect as many lymph nodes as you can find. They may be difficult to find if the patient received previous treatment
9. Submit ALL the lymph nodes you can find and if adequate lymph nodes are not identified, you may need to go back to the bucket

## Description:
Right hemicolectomies are a type of complex resection because it contains terminal ileum, appendix (unless surgically absent), cecum and typically ascending colon. The depth of invasion is the most important feature related to staging along with capturing all of the lymph nodes both locally and regionally for accurate staging.

## Sections for Histology:
- Pilot section of tumor (usually 1st block with ‘pilot’ other block number)
- Margins (proximal, distal, radial) en face
- Appendix bisected tip and representative cross section if attached
- Lesion 1/cm or entirely submitted depending on size and if carcinoma is confirmed on biopsy or suspected
- Any other findings
- Lymph nodes - **ALL** of them
  - A minimum of 12 are required for adequate staging

## Dictation Example: 
Received [fresh for tumor banking and subsequently placed in formalin] in a container labeled "[Patient name/ MRN/ Right hemicolectomy]" is a [non-]perforated hemicolectomy specimen, [# x # x #] cm, consisting of terminal ileum [# x #], appendix [# x #] cm, and cecum and ascending colon, [# x #] cm.  
The terminal ileum margin is inked [green], the distal margin is inked [blue], and [the puckering on the serosal surface is inked [black]. 

The serosa [has dense adhesions on the cecum and colon and is otherwise tan-pink and smooth]. Cut surfaces demonstrate a [100% circumferential, brown, pink, irregular ulceration with a red center, [# x # x #] cm in [the ascending colon/cecum]. It is [#] cm from the proximal margin, [#] cm from the distal margin, and [#] cm from the radial margin. The ulceration extends [into the mesentery] and is [#] cm from the mesenteric margin. 

The remaining mucosa is [unremarkable tan-pink and with appropriate mucosal folds]. Gross photographs are taken. Multiple possible lymph nodes were identified within the adipose, up to [#] cm in greatest dimension which are entirely submitted along with representative sections as follows:</br>

([A1) Tumor, pilot, including deepest point of invasion</br>
([A2) Proximal bowel resection margin</br>
([A3) Distal bowel resection margin</br>
([A4) Closest deep resection margin</br>
([A5) Additional lesion, deepest point of invasion</br>
([A6-A12) Additional lesion, representative</br>
([A13) Cecal wall thickening to appendiceal orifice</br>
([A14) Uninvolved small and large bowel</br>
([A15]) Appendix, bisected tip, and cross section</br>
([A16-A17]) One lymph node candidate, bisected</br>
([A18]) One lymph node candidate, bisected</br>
([A19]) One lymph node candidate, bisected</br>
([A20]) Ten intact lymph node candidates</br>
([A21]) Five intact lymph node candidates
