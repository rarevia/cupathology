**Example Headers:** “Stoma, ileostomy:”

## Triage Needed:
None, usually received in formalin.

## Procedure: 
1. Document the specimen as it was received (overall measurements) and describe what is present (skin, protruding mucosa, viable/normal bowel, and/or any lesions or abnormalities). 
2. Remove the staple line and put the margin en face in a cassette.
3. A perpendicular section through the stoma to include the exposed mucosa, relationship to the peripheral skin, and mucosa deep to the opening. This can be completed in one section provided there are no lesions or abnormalities. 
4. If lesions and/or abnormalities are present, these must be described, measured, and the distance to the peripheral and bowel margin are required for microscopic examination. Note if this patient has a history of a variety of cancers in the abdomen, the most likely site for a metastasis is along the periphery of the specimen and less likely on the mucosal surface. 
5. The margin needs to be submitted along with a section through the stoma in two cassettes.

## Description:
These specimens are often removed when there is revision surgery, the stoma needs to be moved, or the bowels are reconnected, and the stoma is no longer necessary. Aside from documentation of the ileostomy specimen, the gross exam should include the condition of the stoma and mucosa to make sure the bowel was not incarcerated or dusky. The viability of the mucosal margin needs to be confirmed and ensure there is no pathology on the mucosal surface and along the periphery of the soft tissues and bowel. 

## Sections for Histology:
- Perpendicular section through the stomal opening
- Mucosal resection margin, en face, if there are any lesions

## Dictation Example: 
Received in a formalin container labeled "[patient's name/MRN/site]" is [an intact/disrupted] [ileostomy/colostomy] specimen, [# x # x #] cm, with staples across the base margin. The stoma is [patent and viable without protrusion of the mucosal surface]. The stomal opening is [circumferentially rimmed by [gray-tan] skin up to [0.2] cm in thickness]. Cut surfaces demonstrate a [viable tan mucosa with appropriate mucosal folds and no discrete lesions]. 

Representative sections are submitted as follows:

(A2) Resection margin, en face
