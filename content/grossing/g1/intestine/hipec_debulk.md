## Example Headers:
Left anterior peritoneum, peritonectomy

## Triage Needed:
None, if fresh (and no ancillary testing requested) can be placed in formalin. Often sent fresh for tissue banking.

## Procedure: 
1. Describe the tissue (or organ) and any identifiable structures or landmarks. Use three dimensions as required.
2. Note if any lesions are identified. These often (but not always) are mucinous or soft, and most commonly along the surfaces of structures, organs, and the abdominal cavity. Use a third dimension to describe if the lesion appears thickened or infiltrative into the tissue. 
3. Describe any normal or other organs/structures within the specimen and detail if they are involved or not with the lesion. 
4. If small (2 blocks) these can be entirely submitted. If larger, representative sections to include structures and involvement are most important. Margins are important if you are sampling the primary lesion or are clinically significant (tumor at margin). 
5. Do not need to follow 1/cm rule if it is metastatic or not the primary specimen. 

## Description:
These specimens are to reduce the tumor burden and increase efficacy of hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) procedures. This procedure is used to treat advanced abdominal cancers. These specimens are typically non routine in the fact that theyâ€™re removed based on the presence of tumor on the outside of them and differ from patient to patient. This part of the manual describes the non-consistency patient to patient and gives a general equation for sections and a basic template to use for the gross description. 

## Sections for Histology: 
- One or two representative sections demonstrating lesion into identifiable structures or adherent to surfaces
- Margins
- Any lesion that appears more solid or has a different appearance

**Dragon Template:** none 

## Dictation Example: 
Received in a formalin container labeled "[patient's name/MRN/site]" is [an irregular, tan-pink, tissue fragment], [# x # x #] cm, with [a translucent mucinous lesion], [# x # x #] cm, [across the peritonealized surface]. The specimen is serially sectioned and submitted entirely in ([A1]).
