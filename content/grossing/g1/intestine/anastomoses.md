**Example Headers:** “Ileum and Colon, Ileocolonic anastomosis, revision

## Triage Needed:
None, if fresh (and no ancillary testing requested) can be placed in formalin.

## Procedure: 
1. Measure the specimen and note if the margins are open/closed or if there is any orientation or anatomic landmarks.
2. Describe the serosal surface and if there is any attached soft tissue.
3. Describe the anastomotic line, if it is well healed, intact, disrupted, dusky, gaping, etc. and the distance to each of the margins.
4. Note the diameter of the lumen throughout the specimen- it is easier to assess prior to opening but can be identified after opening by measuring the circumference of the lumen at several areas and at least pre and post the anastomosis. 
5. The margins adjacent to the anastomotic line should be sampled along with any pathologies or abnormalities that were identified. 
   
## Description:
Anastomoses are revised mostly due to stricture or leak at the staple line. They can also be revised in the event another procedure has occurred and that connection is no longer needed or can be simplified. These are the things to describe and sample when grossing the specimen. Due to the embedded staples, it is appropriate to take sections adjacent to the staples and not through unless staples are pulled. 

## Sections for Histology: 
- Resection margins (sometimes more than 2, maintain orientation if able to discern)
- Any area of perforation or pathology
- Representatives of mucosa adjacent to the anastomotic staple line

## Dictation Example: 
Received in a formalin container labeled "[patient's name/MRN/site]" is [an intact/disrupted] [pedunculated/sessile] polyp with a resection margin that is inked [black].  The specimen is serially sectioned and submitted entirely in ([A1]).
