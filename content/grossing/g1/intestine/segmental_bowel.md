## Example Header:
Colon, transverse, segmental colectomy

## Triage Needed:
The specimen needs to be cut anti-mesenterically (unless the mass is in the way), cleaned of debris, and fixed in formalin. Measurements and margins (if taken) should be documented on container or requisition.

## Procedure: 
1. Measure the length and diameter range of all the components noting the presence or absence of the appendix for right hemicolectomy and total colectomy specimens. Once opened, measure the range of bowel wall thicknesses especially when associated with any of the findings below.
2. Describe the serosal surface of the bowel, noting color, granularity, indurations, perforations, stricture, fistula, anastomoses, distribution of fat, and adhesions and the distance of these to each of the margins. 
3. Describe mucosal surface, noting color, ulcers, pseudopolyps, diverticula, or indurated areas and if there is associated fibrous induration or perforation with abscess into the pericolonic soft tissues.
   - Measure the length, diameter or circumference, wall thickness, location (distance from the closest margin or ileocecal valve) and appearance of any stenosis/stricture. 
4. Indicate extent of disease involvement, and whether it is diffuse, patchy, focal, or multifocal. Measure the length or area if focal disease and document the location (distance to closest margin or ileocecal valve).
5. Palpate/dissect mesenteric tissue for lymph nodes, noting size and appearance of representative nodes (if no cancer identified or suspected a complete dissection is not necessary.

## Description: 
Diverticular disease is often caused by a lack of fiber in the diet leading to strain and a weak bowel wall. The diverticulum can become filled with fecaliths and leak fluids or perforate leading to fecal material going into the pelvic cavity. An ischemic bowel is a complication due to torsion, obstruction, ischemia, or trauma. Sometimes the obstruction or stenosis is due to an otherwise unknown tumor and the specimen is now a resection for primary tumor requiring a complete workup including full lymph node dissection. It is important to note the distances of the diverticula to the margins and dusky bowel also to the margins. The margins should be viable and sampled to confirm. 

## Sections for Histology:
- Margins (proximal, distal, radial) en face
- Diverticula
- Any other findings
- Lymph nodes - sample - a complete lymph node search is not required for a colon without tumor

## Dictation Example: 
Received in formalin labeled "[patient name/ MRN/ Site]" is an unoriented segment of colon, [#] cm in length and a diameter [ranging from 1.5-3.5] cm, with [staples at both resection margins] and attached pericolonic adipose. The serosal surface is [pink-purple and focally ragged]. 

Cut surfaces demonstrate [a markedly irregular, focally congested, tan-pink, soft mucosa] with [regular/irregular] mucosal folding pattern. Sectioning demonstrates [focally thickened, fibrotic bowel wall with numerous mucosal diverticula], [with a prominent # x # x # cm abscess cavity containing yellow-green probable fecal material]. The abscess is present [#] cm from the proximal margin and [#] cm from the distal margin. The remaining diverticula are intact without fecal impaction or perforation. Multiple palpable lymph nodes are identified up to [#] cm in greatest dimension. Representative sections are submitted as follows:</br>

([A1]) Proximal margin, en face</br>
([A2]) Distal margin, en face</br>
([A3]) Representative diverticulum</br>
([A4]) Bowel wall to abscess</br>
([A5]) Lymph node, bisected
