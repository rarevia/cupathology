**CAP synoptic?** Yes 

## Example Headers:
Colon, Low Anterior Resection

## Triage Needed:
The specimen needs to be opened anti-mesenterically (unless mass in the way), cleaned of debris, and fixed in formalin. If the mass is puckering or through the wall, ink over that area. The mesorectal resection plane should be inked a different color. Measurements and margins (if taken) should be documented on container or requisition. A pilot section should be taken and submitted for processing to limit formalin exposure.

## Procedure: 
1. Note the integrity of the mesorectal envelope and take a photo if you are unsure if it is complete, near complete or incomplete
2. Describe and measure the lesion in two dimensions and note the distance to closest proximal, distal, and radial margins. Serially section lesion and measure depth of invasion into wall and distance from inked serosa and radial margin (non-peritonealized surface).
3. Identify and ink the radial margin (non-peritonealized surface) and note if the lesion is located above, at, below, or straddles the retroperitoneal reflection.
4. Photograph cut surface at deepest point of invasion
5. Submit 1/cm of lesion and include one of the greatest depth of invasion and/or an additional to the radial margin ink. If only a treated TUMOR BED is present, submit ENTIRELY.
6. Describe and submit any additional lesions or polyps
7. Dissect and submit as many lymph nodes as you can find: Note: Lymph nodes are difficult to find below the peritoneal reflection in APR or LAR specimens especially with prior treatment.  **Submit ALL the lymph nodes** you can find and if adequate lymph nodes are not identified, you may need to go back to the bucket. This means both a palpated and sectioned adipose that is separated from the bowel segment.

## Description:
These specimens are like hemicolectomy specimens but just with the addition of the anal canal and perianal skin details need to be added along with the completeness of the mesorectal envelope. 

## Sections for Histology: 
- Pilot section of tumor (usually 1st block with ‘pilot’ other block number)
- Margins (proximal, distal, radial, peritoneal) en face 
- Lesion 1/cm or entirely submitted depending on size and if carcinoma is confirmed on biopsy or suspected
- Any other findings
- Lymph nodes - **ALL** of them
  - Minimum of 12 required for adequate staging

**Dragon Template:** “Colo LAR” 

## Dictation Example: 
Received [fresh/ in formalin] in a container labeled “[patient’s name/MRN/site]” is a [non-]perforated, segment of colon [and rectum/anus], [# x # x # cm]. The segment of large intestine is entirely peritonealized. The non-peritonealized portion of bowel is [#] cm and the mesorectal envelope appears [complete]. The serosa is [pink-tan and smooth]. The deep resection margin is inked [black].

Cut surfaces demonstrate a [circumferential, lobulated, exophytic mass], [# x # x #] cm, and is [%] circumferential.  It is on the [anterior/lateral/etc] side of the wall, that is [above/at/below] the peritoneal reflection, [#] cm to the inked deep margin, [#] cm from the proximal margin, and [#] cm from the distal margin. The remaining mucosa is [unremarkable without additional polyp or lesion].  Gross photographs are taken. Multiple possible lymph nodes are identified ranging from [#] to [#] cm in greatest dimension which are entirely submitted along with representative sections as follows:</br>

([A1]) Tumor, pilot section, including greatest depth of invasion</br>
([A#]) Proximal margin, en face</br>
([A#]) Distal margin, en face</br>
([A#]) Closest deep margin</br>
([A#]) Additional lesions</br>
([A#]) [All lymph nodes surrounding the mass designating numbers of candidate lymph nodes per cassette]</br>
([A#]) [All remaining candidate lymph nodes in the specimen including numbers per cassette]
