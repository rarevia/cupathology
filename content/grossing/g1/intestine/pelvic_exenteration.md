**CAP synoptic?** Yes, if it includes the primary resection of the tumor

## Example Header:
Sigmoid Colon, rectum, uterus, and vagina, pelvic exenteration

## Triage Needed:
All organs should be opened if the triage is to open them on individual specimens. Each of these cases is different and confirming with the attending, fellow, senior resident or PA is recommended. A pilot section should be taken and submitted for processing to limit formalin exposure.

## Procedure: 
1. Look into into the history of the lesion, from the H&P, imaging, and notes from the OR procedure
2. Review anatomy and grossing of the individual pelvic organs if needed and then take out the specimen and orient yourself to it and identify organs and structures
3. Discuss plan with the attending, fellow, senior resident or PA and plans to show best pathology
4. Specimen should be triaged and at least fixed for several hours or overnight depending on when it came in
5. Remember your gross should consist of what you have, what are the measurements overall, describing the tumor, how big it is, what does it looks like, and where is it going. If you talk about it, take a section of it. If this is not a primary resection of the primary tumor, lymph nodes and 1/cm do not necessarily apply.
   
## Description:
Pelvic exenterations are an en bloc multivisceral resection of pelvic structures that is used to debulk for a variety of cancers. Each of these cases is different so there is a lack of uniformity in terms of templates. Discussion with an attending, fellow, senior resident, or PA is of the utmost importance as are taking gross photographs. Ultimately, there is a combination of the descriptions and templates of each of the organs involved.

## Sections for Histology: 
- Margins
- 1/cm of tumor if primary resection
- Relationships of tumor to surrounding structures and organs
- Relationships of tumor to margins
- Other structures or organs that are uninvolved
- Lymph nodes if needed 

**Dragon Template:** none

## Dictation Example: 
Received in a formalin container labeled "[patient's name/MRN/site]" is an en bloc resection consisting of rectosigmoid colon, ([#] cm in length and [#] cm in diameter), with attached mesentery, appendix ([#] cm in length, [#] cm, wall thickness of [x] cm), uterus ([#] cm cervix to fundus, [#] cm cornu to cornu, [#] cm anterior to posterior), bilateral fallopian tubes (averaging [#] cm in length and [#] cm in diameter), and bilateral ovaries (averaging [# x # x #] cm). 

The rectosigmoid is [densely adherent to the uterine fundus/posterior uterus, right fallopian tube, and appendix]. The mucosal surface of the rectosigmoid is remarkable for an [irregular fungating mass] that [circumferentially involves the intestinal wall] and is [#] cm from the distal margin and [#] cm from the proximal margin. Sectioning of the mass demonstrates [infiltration into the pericolonic soft tissue with the mass abutting the radial/mesenteric margin]. 

The posterior uterine serosa is densely adherent to the rectum with intervening fibrous tissue, but does not appear to be involved by the mass. (usually thereâ€™s a reason the uterus came out). [The remaining external surface of the uterus is unremarkable. The cervix measures x cm in diameter and has a x cm [slit like] os. The uterus cavity is remarkable for a triangular endometrial cavity (approximately # x # cm) with a x cm thick endometrium and x cm thick myometrium all without lesions.] 

[The left ovary appears grossly unremarkable externally; cut surfaces do not reveal any lesions. The left fallopian tube is identified, though the fimbriated ends are not readily seen. Serially sectioning of the left fallopian tube is otherwise unrevealing.] Gross photographs are taken. Representative sections are submitted as follows:</br>
