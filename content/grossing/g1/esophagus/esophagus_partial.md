**CAP synoptic?** Esophagus

## Example Headers:
- Esophagus, esophagectomy
- Esophagus, distal, partial esophagogastrectomy
  
## Triage Needed:
The circumferential margin is inked, and the specimen is measured (L x D cm) and cut open and pinned. If the margins are taken/measured, it needs to be written on the container or on the requisition.

## Procedure: 
1. These specimens often arrive fresh for frozen section diagnosis and or tissue banking. If there are ANY outstanding questions regarding how the specimen was received, pertinent measurements, appearance, relationships, if it was intact or disrupted and what was frozen if it is not clear you MUST follow up with the responsible individuals or ask a PA for assistance. Not asking for clarification or doing some investigation is not acceptable. 
2. If the specimen is not inked and opened, ink the radial esophageal margin and any puckering or abnormality on the serosal surface of the stomach. The serosal surface does not need to be inked because it will rub off. If there is puckering or exposed tumor the ink will stick to those abnormalities.
3. Open the specimen to avoid the lesion (use a finger to probe and identify the lesion prior to cutting that area). It is most common to open along the greater curvature, but if the lesion is in the way, this can be modified. If the lesion is cut into that is ok as it may be not palpable or circumferential. If it is bisected remember to add both sides together for the measurement. 
4. Grossly determine from which structure the tumor arises: is it gastric, gastroesophageal junctional, or esophageal in origin.  To do this, examine the appearance of the tumor and its relationship (i.e., tumor epicenter) to the gastroesophageal junction.  
5. Measure the distance of the tumor’s epicenter from the gastroesophageal junction.  
6. Describe the lesion along with its dimensions and distances to the proximal, distal, and radial/deep margin. 
7. Describe the remaining mucosa both esophagus and stomach including any additional lesions or abnormalities. 
8. Palpate the esophageal and stomach adipose for lymph node candidates. While there is not a specific number of lymph nodes required for esophageal carcinoma, there is for gastric and ALL the lymph nodes must be identified and submitted. 
  -If only a few were palpated and or at the direction of the attending or fellow- all periesophageal and peri gastric adipose can be submitted following the lymph node search for additional lymph node capture. 

## Description:
Many patients have received neoadjuvant treatment and viable tumor may be difficult to find; it may be necessary to entirely submit the site of tumor. Sectioning the lesional area and the gastroesophageal junction to include that relationship is essential to the diagnosis of this tumor.

## Sections for Histology:
- Esophageal margin (sometimes submitted for frozen section)
- Closest distal stomach margin (also usually submitted for frozen section)
  - When to submit the entire margin?
- Radial margin (often submitted in lesional area submission)
- Lesion- due to treatment may be entire gastroesophageal margin
  - If not entirely submitted- include section with greatest depth of invasion and to the margin
- Additional polyps or areas of concern
- All lymph nodes - esophageal lymph nodes are in radially inked paraesophageal soft tissues and are often very small
  - Perigastric lymph nodes also searched for and submitted in lesser/greater omentum
  - If minimal minimal tissue submitted all adipose can be submitted FOLLOWING adequate search for possible additional lymph node capture.

## Dictation Example: 
Received [fresh for frozen section diagnosis and subsequently placed in formalin] in a container labeled "[patient's name/MRN/site]" is a [# x # x #] cm esophagogastrectomy specimen with [staples] along the resection margins.  The segment of [distal] esophagus is [#] cm in length and averages [#] cm in diameter.  The proximal stomach is [# x # x #] cm.  The adventitia of the esophagus is [ragged, intact] and inked [black]. The serosa of the stomach is [smooth and glistening].  The specimen is opened to reveal a [# x # x #] cm [tan-pink and ulcerated] lesion located [#] cm from the proximal margin and [#] cm from the closest distal margin.  The lesion [straddles] the gastroesophageal junction with an epicenter located [in the esophagus], [#] cm from the gastroesophageal junction.  Upon sectioning, the lesion invades [into but not through] [the muscularis] to a depth of [#] cm and [#] cm to the circumferential esophageal margin.  The uninvolved esophageal is [white and glistening with appropriate mucosal folds].  The uninvolved gastric mucosa is [tan and glistening with appropriate rugal folds].  The periesophageal and perigastric adipose is dissected for possible lymph node candidates that are [#] to [#] cm in greatest dimension. A gross photograph is taken.  Representative sections, including the [entire lesion] and all possible lymph nodes are submitted as follows:</br>

([A1]) Proximal margin, en face</br>
([A2]) Closest distal margin, en face</br>
([A3]-[A#]) Lesion, including deepest point of invasion and relationship to adventitial margin</br>
([A#]) Representative uninvolved esophagus</br>
([A#]-[A#]) Lymph node candidates
