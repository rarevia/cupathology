To ensure proper key characteristics, measurements and sampling occur in the grossing of breast specimens (partial/simple/skin sparing/nipple sparing/modified radical/radical mastectomy, etc.) please take note of the following considerations, required sections, and template below. ALL cancer breasts need to be scanned in the Faxitron and images used for clip localization and confirmation. The prophylactic side can be bypassed if no clips/suspicion for bilateral disease.

Keep in mind each breast specimen is unique and deviation from the template can occur as long as all required elements and sections are included.

### Triage
- Confirm the laterality of the breast on the container and requisition sheet. Additionally confirm the orientation using any attached designators (e.g., sutures). **If discordant**, confirm that an error is present with a PA or your attending. You may need to call the opearting room for assistance.

- Write down the weight and measure the dimensions of the specimen
  - {{< color_pill color="Crimson" textcolor="#fff" >}}Superior{{< /color_pill >}}-to-{{< color_pill color="Yellow" textcolor="DarkOrchid" >}}inferior{{< /color_pill >}}
  - {{< color_pill color="Green" textcolor="#fff" >}}Medial{{< /color_pill >}}-to-{{< color_pill color="MediumBlue" textcolor="#fff" >}}lateral{{< /color_pill >}}
  - {{< color_pill color="DarkOrange" textcolor="#fff" >}}Anterior{{< /color_pill >}}-to-{{< color_pill color="Black" textcolor="#fff" >}}posterior{{< /color_pill >}}

- Ink the specimen according to the protocol ([see Sample dictation for the inking conventions](#dictation)). Any deviations from the standard inking convention must be noted on the requisition sheet.
- Serially section the specimen perpendicular to the superior-inferior axis into thin slices (approximately 1 cm or less) trying to get teh posterior surface in each slice. Cut the slices deep enough to be able to view the whole slice. If skin is present along the anterior surface, it will help hold the specimen together.
- When the entire specimen is sectioned, collect a sample for the tissue bank (if this was consented for); othewise, put the specimen into formalin.
- If a clip or savi scout is dislodged, secure a safety pin in the slice/location for reference.
  - **If a radioactive seed is found - <mark>stop what you are doing</mark> - tell a PA or Gross Tech to make sure it is handled appropriately.**
- When the entire specimen is laod out, wrap the specimen so taht the slices will stay secure within the container.
- Note the **in formalin time** on the requistion sheet and if a tumor sample or normal breast tissue sample was give to teh biorepository.

### Grossing
Elements to include:
- Weight of entire specimen (look on lid or requisition if triaged)
- Dimensions:
  - superior-to-inferior
  - medial-to-lateral
  - anterior-to-posterior
  - and overall size of axillary dissection (if present)
-	Measurements of skin ellipse (if present) along with description of any lesions
- Nipple size, retraction, inversion, and description
-	Deep margin irregularities (fascial plane should be smooth and intact)
-	Lesion: size, location, quadrant, length from nipple, color, distance to margins, presence of clip(s)
-	Description: color, borders, consistency, relationship to margins (anterior,
-	Posterior/deep, skin (medial/lateral if involved))
-	Description of remaining tissue
-	Faxitron findings
-	Lymph nodes and size if axillary dissection is present
  - Also, **ALWAYS** check lateral aspect for low lymph nodes incidentally removed and submit entirely
-	Muscle dimensions and presence/absence of involvement if present on the deep aspect

Required Sections:
-	Nipple and skin, perpendicular
-	Lesion in plane of greatest dimension including to all closest margins:
    - superior
    - inferior
    - anterior
    - posterior/deep
    - medial
    - lateral
-	Sections in plane of lesion on either side of greatest dimension (appear uninvolved)
-	Tissue between two lesions (if applicable)
-	Representative sections (2 and can be in 1 cassette) of uninvolved breast in each of the 4 quadrants
-	Muscle if present

### Dictation template {#dictation}
Received fresh in a container labeled “\[Patient’s name/MRN\]” and designated “\[\_\_\_\]” is a \[\_\_\_\] gram, \[name of specimen/procedure\] specimen, \[\_\_\_\] cm superior to inferior, \[\_\_\_\] cm medial to lateral, \[\_\_\_\] cm anterior to posterior. Partially surfacing the anterior aspect is a skin ellipse \[\_\_\_x\_\_\_\] cm with an \[everted/inverted\] nipple. \[There is an attached axillary dissection \_\_\_x\_\_\_x\_\_\_ cm.\] There is a \[\_\_\_\] suture designating \[superior\] and \[\_\_\_\] suture designating \[lateral\] as per the requisition. The specimen is sliced from \[\_\_\_\] to \[\_\_\_\] into \[\_\_\_] slices.

In slice(s) \[\_\_\_\] there is a \[describe lesion\], \[\_\_\_x\_\_\_x\_\_\_\] cm, at \[\_\_\_\] o’clock, in the \[\_\_\_\] quadrant, \[\_\_\_\] cm from the nipple, and \[\_\_\_\] cm from the \[anterior\] margin and \[\_\_\_\] cm from the deep margin. \[Include measurements to any other pertinent margin (medial/lateral/skin)\]. There is a \[\_\_\_\] clip identified within the lesion.

\[\_\_\_\] cm from lesion 1 in slice(s) \[\_\_\_\] is a \[describe lesion\], \[\_\_\_x\_\_\_x\_\_\_\] cm, at \[\_\_\_\] o’clock, in the \[\_\_\_\] quadrant, \[\_\_\_\] cm from the nipple, and \[\_\_\_\] cm from the \[anterior\] margin and \[\_\_\_\] cm from the deep margin. \[Include measurements to any other pertinent margin (medial/lateral/skin)\]. There is a \[\_\_\_\] clip identified within the lesion. The remaining breast tissue is \[\_\_\_\] consisting of \[\_\_\_\]% breast tissue. The skin surface is remarkable for \[\_\_\_\].

The specimen is inked as follows: anterior-superior-\[yellow\], anterior-inferior-\[green\], posterior-superior- \[black\], posterior-inferior- \[blue\]. \[The retro-areolar area is inked orange\].

Representative sections are submitted as follows:

([A1]) [Slice below lesion in lowest slice (if lesion is in 5-9, submit representative of slice 4 in plane of lesion)] </br>
([A2-6]) [Lesion from lower slice number to higher, sequentially (slices 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) all in same plane designating slice number and closest margins (if applicable include 2nd greatest dimension sequentially at appropriate slice level)]</br>
([A7]) [Slice higher than lesion in highest slice (slice 10, in plane of lesion)]</br>
([A8]) [(if applicable) tissue between lesion 1 and lesion 2]</br>
([A9-13]) [Lesion 2 in similar fashion to above]</br>
([A14]) [Skin and nipple]</br>
([A15]) [Skin lesions (if applicable)]</br>
([A16]) [Slice #, upper outer quadrant, 2 pieces]</br>
([A17]) [Slice #, lower outer quadrant, 2 pieces]</br>
([A18]) [Slice #, lower inner quadrant, 2 pieces]</br>
([A19]) [Slice #, upper inner quadrant, 2 pieces]

{{< callout note >}} The **time in foramlin** and the **time out of formalin** can be found in CoPath. From the *Histology Data Entry/Edit* menu, the in formalin and out formalin date and times are displayed within the *Materials Matching* screen. From the *Pathologist Console* menu, the in formalin and out formalin date and times are displayed within the *Source/Staff* screen. {{< /callout >}}

### Processing
- Place cassettes in the rack along with other non-breast cassettes Monday through Friday **unless** if the breast tissue was removed from the patient on Thursday afternoon (see below).
- If the breast tissue was removed from the patient on Thursday afternoon (and is grossed on Friday), then the container the specimen is in will have a biohazard sticker on it (this sticker is our way of designating that this specimen should follow this "Thursday breast protocol")
  - These cassettes will need to be separated in the rack on top of the decal and labeled with the Thursday breast sign.
  - These rack will be loaded Friday night and the weekend residents will take them out of the processor on Saturday morning.
- <mark>If there is a lot to process during the week and it won't all fit on the Peloris machines, then prioritize the breast rack to go on the Peloris machines (you do not have to move them to different racks)</mark>
- <mark>Circle the appropriate processing information on the breast log on the door to histology. This is to complete the fixation times and ensure we do not have to log each individual case.</mark>
