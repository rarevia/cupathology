## Lumpectomy or Excisional Biopsy

All breast specimens are received fresh for triaging; then, formalin is added to the container when finished, and the **in formalin time** is written on the requistion sheet and added to the breast log.

### Triage
- If there is a radioactive seed present within the specimen, then it must be triaged by trained personnel. <mark>See SOP</mark>
- Write down the weight and measure the dimensions of the specimen
  - {{< color_pill color="Crimson" textcolor="#fff" >}}Superior{{< /color_pill >}}-to-{{< color_pill color="Yellow" textcolor="DarkOrchid" >}}inferior{{< /color_pill >}}
  - {{< color_pill color="Green" textcolor="#fff" >}}Medial{{< /color_pill >}}-to-{{< color_pill color="MediumBlue" textcolor="#fff" >}}lateral{{< /color_pill >}}
  - {{< color_pill color="DarkOrange" textcolor="#fff" >}}Anterior{{< /color_pill >}}-to-{{< color_pill color="Black" textcolor="#fff" >}}posterior{{< /color_pill >}}
- Ink the specimen according to the protocol ([see Sample dictaiton for the inking conventions](#dictation)). Any deviations from the standard inking convention must be noted on the requisition sheet.
- Serially section the specimen perpendicular to the long axis and it out flat on a napkin or gauze while keeping the margin maps/clips intact when possible. If a clip/savi scout is dislodged, secure a safety pin in the slice/location for reference.
  - **If a radioactive seed is found - <mark>stop what you are doing</mark> - tell a PA or Gross Tech to make sure it is handled appropriately.**
- When the entire specimen is laod out, wrap the specimen so taht the slices will stay secure within the container.
- Note the **in formalin time** on the requistion sheet and if a tumor sample or normal breast tissue sample was give to teh biorepository.

### Grossing
- Look up the patient's history in EPIC and determine the suspected size and type of lesion, if there are any clips present, and any other pertinent history (as the history on th requisition sheet may be incomplete).
- Review **all** breast specimens with your attending or their designee (discuss your attending's preferences for specimen review at the beginning of the service week).
- Take gross photographs of the laid out specimen and print it out for mapping (ask someone if you do not know how to do this).
- Find lesions/clips/scouts within the laid out specimen. You can put the specimen back together to re-approximate the size of lesions. Note what slice the lesions is in, what clips/scouts are present to identify lesions, and the distances from the lesions to all margins:
    - superior
    - inferior
    - anterior
    - posterior/deep
    - medial
    - lateral
- On the printed photograph depicting the laid out specimen, draw which pieces of tissue are submitted in which cassettes (i.e., create a cassette key). Write the case number on the sheet.
- Any lumpectomy that can be submitted entirely in 15 cassettes or fewer should be submitted entirely.

### Sample dictation {#dictation}
Received fresh in a container labeled "\[Patient's name/MRN\]" and designated "\[\_\_\_\]" is a \[\_\_\_\] gram, \[lumpectomy/excisional biopsy\] specimen, \[\_\_\_\] cm superior to inferior, \[\_\_\_\] cm medial to lateral, \[\_\_\_\] cm anterior to posterior. {{< if_pill >}}(*If present*: Patially surfacing the anterior aspect is a skin ellipse, \_\_\_x\_\_\_ cm){{< /if_pill >}}. There is a \[\_\_\_\] suture designating \[superior\] and \[\_\_\_\] suture designating \[lateral\] as per the requisition. The specimen is sliced from \[\_\_\_\] to \[\_\_\_\] into \[\_\_\_\] slices.

In slice(s) \[\_\_\_\] there is a \[describe lesion\], \[\_\_\_x\_\_\_x\_\_\_\] cm. The lesion is \[\_\_\_\] cm from the superior maring, \[\_\_\_\] cm from the inferior margin, \[\_\_\_\] from the anterior margin, \[\_\_\_\] from the posterior/deep maring, \[\_\_\_\] cm from the medial margin and \[\_\_\_\] cm from the lateral maring. There is a \[shape\] clip identified in slice \[\_\_\_\] and a \[savi scout in slice \_\_\_\].

Ink key: {{< color_pill color="Crimson" textcolor="#fff" >}}\[superior - red\]{{< /color_pill >}}, {{< color_pill color="Yellow" textcolor="DarkOrchid" >}}\[inferior - yellow\]{{< /color_pill >}}, {{< color_pill color="DarkOrange" textcolor="#fff" >}}\[anterior - orange\]{{< /color_pill >}}, {{< color_pill color="Black" textcolor="#fff" >}}\[posterior/deep - black\]{{< /color_pill >}}, {{< color_pill color="Green" textcolor="#fff" >}}\[medial - green\]{{< /color_pill >}} and {{< color_pill color="MediumBlue" textcolor="#fff" >}}\[lateral - blue\]{{< /color_pill >}} {{<if_pill>}}(*if present*: and the retro-areolar area - orange){{< /if_pill >}}.

The specimen is submitted \[entirely\] from \[\_\_\_\] to \[\_\_\_\] as follows:

([A1-2]) [slice 1, superior end, perpendicularly sectioned, closest to superior margin] </br>
([A3]) [slice 2, superior end of lesion] </br>
([A4]) [slice 3, closest to anterior margin, clip] </br>
([A5]) [slice 4, closest to posterior and lateral margin] </br>
([A6]) [slice 5, lesion] </br>
([A7]) [slice 6, closest medial margin] </br>
([A8]) [slice 7] </br>
([A9]) [slice 8, inferior end, perpendicularly sectioned]

Date and time in formalin: ##/##/#### ##:##</br>
Date and time out of formalin: ##/##/#### ##:##

{{< callout note >}} The **time in foramlin** and the **time out of formalin** can be found in CoPath. From the *Histology Data Entry/Edit* menu, the in formalin and out formalin date and times are displayed within the *Materials Matching* screen. From the *Pathologist Console* menu, the in formalin and out formalin date and times are displayed within the *Source/Staff* screen. {{< /callout >}}

### Processing
- Place cassettes in the rack along with other non-breast cassettes Monday through Friday **unless** if the breast tissue was removed from the patient on Thursday afternoon (see below).
- If the breast tissue was removed from the patient on Thursday afternoon (and is grossed on Friday), then the container the specimen is in will have a biohazard sticker on it (this sticker is our way of designating that this specimen should follow this "Thursday breast protocol")
  - These cassettes will need to be separated in the rack on top of the decal and labeled with the Thursday breast sign.
  - These rack will be loaded Friday night and the weekend residents will take them out of the processor on Saturday morning.
- <mark>If there is a lot to process during the week and it won't all fit on the Peloris machines, then prioritize the breast rack to go on the Peloris machines (you do not have to move them to different racks)</mark>
- <mark>Circle the appropriate processing information on the breast log on the door to histology. This is to complete the fixation times and ensure we do not have to log each individual case.</mark>
