## Breast tissue for mammoplasty, gynecomastia, or gender-affirming mastectomy

### Triage
- If the breast tissue is oriented, then treat the specimen as you would an oriented bresat specimen: ink the specimen (and double check the orientation).
- Weigh, measure the dimensions, and note the in formalin time
- If the breast tissue is unoriented (and possible fragmented), then you do not need to ink the specimen; however, if the specimen is one large unoriented tissue aggregate, then ink it one color.

### Grossing
- Slice the specimen at < 1 cm intervals, checking the tissue for foci of calcification, puckering, induration, or other lesions.
- Representative sections should be submitted in 3 cassettes (2 pieces per cassette), including:
  - Skin
  - Breast tissue
  - Any abnormalities

### Sample dictation
Received fresh and subsequently placed in a formalin contained labeled "\[patient name/MRN\]" and designated "\[\_\_\_\]," is a \[\_\_\_\] g [aggregate] of yellow lobulated adipose, \[\_\_\_x\_\_\_x\_\_\_\] cm, including one piece surfaced by wrinkled, tan and hair-bearing skin devoid of nipple and discrete lesions. Cut surfaces demonstrate [yellow lobulated adipose with scan fibrous breast tissue]. Representative sections are submitted in cassettes ([A1-A3]).

### Processing
- Place cassettes in the rack along with other non-breast cassettes Monday through Friday **unless** if the breast tissue was removed from the patient on Thursday afternoon (see below).
- If the breast tissue was removed from the patient on Thursday afternoon (and is grossed on Friday), then the container the specimen is in will have a biohazard sticker on it (this sticker is our way of designating that this specimen should follow this "Thursday breast protocol")
  - These cassettes will need to be separated in the rack on top of the decal and labeled with the Thursday breast sign.
  - These rack will be loaded Friday night and the weekend residents will take them out of the processor on Saturday morning.
- <mark>If there is a lot to process during the week and it won't all fit on the Peloris machines, then prioritize the breast rack to go on the Peloris machines (you do not have to move them to different racks)</mark>
- <mark>Circle the appropriate processing information on the breast log on the door to histology. This is to complete the fixation times and ensure we do not have to log each individual case.</mark>
